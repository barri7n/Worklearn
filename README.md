Todo:

* Ask Satish about google credits
* Find out google output from soup
* Do data exploration on the current elephant/tiger dataset to find out about the best search words
* Fix Line Break \r\n in Articles column

Task 1: Find articles that are similar, use a web crawler and if the article is similar, input that article into task 2
