Todo:
* Webscraper needs to identify different sections of the Article(i.e. each source has a different layout for the article)
* Continue Google Vertex setup

Task 1: Find articles that are similar, use a web crawler and if the article is similar, input that article into task 2

* Percentage based output, treat it as a classification

Task 2: Predict basic columns first such as date of event, state, district, date of report, villages, country, number of casualties(elephant/humans)
