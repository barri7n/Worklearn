Guwahati: A five-year-old elephant was knocked down by a speeding truck on NH-37 near Kaziranga National Park, about 250 km from here, on Saturday. The elephant was hit on the head by the truck while it was crossing the road in the Amguri area under Burapahar forest range of the park around 5.15 am.



Movement of animals on the highway has increased following inundation of several parts of Kaziranga. During floods, animals from Kaziranga cross over the highway to reach higher grounds in Karbi Anglong district. "Our guards man all the posts along the highway between Amguri and Kohra from evening to early morning for restricting vehicular speed. It is very unfortunate that the lone elephant was knocked down after the guards left their posts at 4 am," Kaziranga DFO D D Gogoi said. This was Kaziranga's first elephant casualty in highway accidents in five years. Last week, about three deer were run over by vehicles on the highway. Park officials said the elephant crossed the highway to feed on paddy on the other side of the park.



Increase of traffic along the highway has become a bane for Kaziranga, the only Unesco World Heritage Site in the state. About 2,000 vehicles take the highway everyday, considerably contributing pollution to Kaziranga. During night, about 500 trucks ply the highway. Soon after floods engulfed a sizeable part of 430 sq km national park last month, Kaziranga authorities started issuing time cards to vehicles taking the highway between Amguri and Kohra a distance of 37 km which they have to cover in not less than 51 minutes. The guards deployed at the two ends slap fine on the driver if a vehicle was found to have reached less than the prescribed time.
