A wild elephantwas found shot dead inside the Wayanad Wildlife
Sanctuary(WWS) Monday morning.

The carcass of a female elephant, aged around 13 years, was found at
Nalam Mile on the side of the Sultan Bathery- Pulpally road which cuts
through the Kurichiad range of the sanctuary.

The elephant had a bullet wound in the left side of its head. The body
was found in a kneeling down position just five metres from the road.

WWS warden P Dhanesh Kumar said that the elephant could have been shot
suspectedly by persons from inside a vehicle. He said that the
elephant was frequently sighted by motorists standing along the road
side in the forest stretch.

This is how the human destroyed the nature. The cruelty to animal
should be investigated and the guilty must be punished. Hope, someone
would bring in some info on the killers.Godfather Senior

"According to preliminary information, It is not a case of poaching.
Also no crop raiding incidents have been reported from the area
recently. We suspect that a country made gun was used to kill the
elephant. More details would be known only after the post mortem," he
said.

WWS warden has announced a cash reward of Rs 25000 to anyone who can
provide information leading to the arrest of the suspect. Anyone with
