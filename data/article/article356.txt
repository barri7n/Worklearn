PALAKKAD:  A female elephant in an advanced stage of pregnancy fell into an
unused well in a private compound at Mattayi in Poongode, Pothundy and died
instantly in Nenmara here on Monday.

Nenmara forest range officer B Renjith said that the post mortem
examination performed by veterinarians Dr Biju and Dr Jayasree  revealed
that there was a fully developed calf inside its stomach.

The she-elephant which was between the age of 15 to 20 years could not see
the well which had no compound wall as it was pitch dark. He said that
there was a street light around 20 metres away but it was not functioning
due to the rains and winds.

The well had a depth of more than 20 metres and it was in a private
compound. The elephant fell with its face down and was suffocated to death
as it could not move.

He said the elephant would have been part of a herd which frequented the
area as the forests were located around 30 metres away.

The forest personnel who reached the spot included Divisional Forest
Officer N Rajesh, foresters, guards and watchers. Initially a slope was
made into the well. It was the watchers who entered the well and tied
the ropes to the legs of the elephant to pull it out using earth movers.

After the post mortem, the carcass of the elephant was buried in the nearby
Nelliampathy forests.
