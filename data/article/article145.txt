SURAT THANI : The consumption of pesticide is being looked at as a possible cause of death of a male elephant found dead in a vegetable garden, officials say.



The 30-year-old wild elephant with two perfect tusks measuring about 60cm each was believed to have died at least 20 hours before it was found in a vegetable garden yesterday near Khlong Kratae in Kanchanadit district.



The animal suffered from diarrhoea and internal bleeding before it died, said a veterinarian who was among a team from Tai Romyen national park that rushed to the scene.



Traces of pesticide were found about 30metres from the elephant, and officials said it was possible the animal had eaten some.



Garden owner Tiang Srisuk, 45, said she went to pick vegetables and found her makeshift shelter had been damaged.



Small bags of pesticide which were kept inside the shelter had fallen to the ground and some vegetable plots were damaged. Ms Tiang said she followed footprints and found the dead elephant.



Sukrit Krataichan, head of the national park, said an autopsy would be held.



Veerakiart Lakkhachai, chief of the Tai Romyen forestry development project, said elephants living around the national park foraged for food in nearby villages.
