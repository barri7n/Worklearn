Poachers have struck once again and killed an elephant in the Lansdowne 
Forest Range of India's northern Uttaranchal state, officials said on 
Friday.

Forest guards discovered the body while on a routine patrol of the area.

Officials believe the poachers must have fled under the cover of darkness 
after leaving the pachyderm's dismembered body. The head and tusks had been 
removed.

The incident has created a flutter in the forest department.

"We have declared a red alert in the region," Ramesh Chandra, chief wildlife 
warden of Uttaranchal, said.

"All the staff has been mobilized and teams have begun combing the forests. 
We have contacted the forest officials of all districts bordering our range 
and their staff has been asked to coordinate with our staff. Local people 
also have been appealed to provide any information in the case," he added.

Chandra said they have intensified patrolling after several attempts of 
poaching came to light recently. This time the poachers walked away 
successfully.

Frequent poaching has led to a decrease in the number of elephants in India, 
which has more than 50 percent of the world's Asiatic elephant population.

There has been an increase in demand of the Asiatic tusker due to the sharp 
drop in elephant poaching in Africa.

A recent survey estimated that there were 25,000 to 28,000 elephants in 
India, including only 1,500 male tuskers of breeding age.

Although trafficking of wildlife products is banned in India, poaching of 
animals for their skin, bones and body parts, continues. Environmentalists 
say the Indian government is not doing enough to protect its wildlife. (ANI)
