COIMBATORE: The carcasses of a 30-year-old female elephant and its
six-year-old male calf were found in a farmland at Thasampalayam in Tamil
Nadu on Tuesday morning.

Forest officials said the elephant and its calf were electrocuted when they
came into contact with an electric fence in the farmland, situated near
Nellimalai reserve forest in Mettupalayam forest range, on Monday night.

A one-and-a-half-year-old calf that suffered injuries was rescued and sent
for treatment.

The land belonged to Palanisamy. The farmer had kept the electric fence to
prevent the entry of wild boars.

District forest officer Ramasubramanian, Mettupalayam forest range officer
Nazir and Tangedco officials were in the spot.
