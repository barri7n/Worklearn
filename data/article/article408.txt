ANGUL: Decomposed carcass of a tusker was found in a forest near
Jagannathpur village in Krushnachankragarh reserve forest under Angul
division on Saturday.

Sources said the six-year-old animal might have died after coming in
contact with live wire laid for poaching a few days back. Locals saw the
carcass and informed forest officials, who sent it for postmortem. Forest
officials, though, refused to reveal anything about the reason of death.
Two months back, another tusker was found dead at the same spot under
similar circumstances. Poachers have been laying live wires in the forest
for killing boars and forest officials are a mute spectator to the crime.
