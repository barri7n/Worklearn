An elephant was found dead, believed to have been electrocuted from an
illegally-drawn wire, at Vadderahalli on the southern outskirts of the city
on Friday morning.

Forest officials said the tusker-less male elephant, aged about 40-45
years, was found barely 150m from the border of the Bannerghatta National
Park.

“The area commonly sees elephant movements in the past, and crop loss
compensation is the highest here. After grazing in the farmlands nearby on
Thursday night, it was returning to the forests when it came in contact
with the live wire placed on the floor,” said Varun Kumar, Range Forest
Officer (Kaggalipura).

The officer says the owner of the land, Prabhu Kumar, and his family had
drawn the wire from an electric pole to keep away wild boars which were
causing crop loss.

However, the pachyderm came in contact with this and died on the spot. “The
accused have cleared the wires, and have fled. We have registered a case
under the Wildlife Act,” said Mr. Varun Kumar.

The area is a critical corridor which connects Bannerghatta National Park
and the hillocks of Savandurga.

The traditional elephant corridor, which is also seeing rapid urbanisation,
has become a theatre of man-elephant conflict, which flared in 2016-end
when Sidda, a tusker, battled for life for nearly 40 days after being shot
at by villagers.
