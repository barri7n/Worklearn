A man has been killed by an elephant after his speeding car hit the animal
near a national park in Thailand, police have said.

When the vehicle struck the elephant’s hind legs, it responded by stomping
on the car, destroying the engine and killing the driver, said lieutenant
colonel Kemchat Paedkaew.

The accident happened on Wednesday on a small road with signs telling
drivers to be aware of wild animals that sometimes stray from Khao Yai
National Park in the northeastern part of the country.

Mr Paedkaew said the driver was not local and failed to slow down when he
encountered the elephant.

“Elephants don’t come out during the day but they start coming out when it
gets dark,” he said, adding that up to two people a year are killed by
elephants in areas surrounding the park.

The elephant was guided back to the park and is being looked after by
officials.

It comes weeks after a German woman was trampled to death by an elephant as
she tried to take a photograph of the animal in Zimbabwe.

In 2015, visitors to Khao Yai were warned to be careful, after attacks by
elephants had previously damaged cars, a shop and a restaurant.
