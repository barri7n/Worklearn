KRISHNAGIRI: An elephant sustained minor injuries and one of its tusks was
broken after a Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation bus knocked it down
near Krishnagiri on Wednesday.

According to forest officials, a herd of three elephants came out of the
forest and tried to cross the Chennai-Bangalore National Highways near
Kundarapalli.

"Two jumbos managed to cross the road. A tusker, which came behind the two
elephants, suddenly turned back and moved towards the bus," a forest
official said.

Bus driver P Kumaresan, 38, tried his best to avoid the vehicle hitting the
elephant, but in vain. The bus knocked down the tusker.

One of the tusks of the elephant got broken in the accident. The elephant
sustained minor injuries too. Officials said the broken tusk weighed around
3.5kg.

Kumaresan, who suffered injuries, was rushed to Government Hospital in
Krishnagiri.

The bus was going to Hosur from Chennai. There were more than 40 passengers
on board the bus.

Traffic on the Chennai-Bangalore National Highway was affected after the
accident.

Forest officials were monitoring the injured elephant, which moved to the
banks of a nearby lake.
