SILIGURI, 11 JUNE: Forest officials at Panighata near Siliguri today detected an injured wild elephant allegedly shot at by the Nepal police Tuesday night.
The injured pachyderm, which is an adult, is limping on its right leg, officials said. The foresters however, are yet to confirm that the wound was indeed a bullet-injury, which they are suspecting.
The injured pachyderm is part of a herd of 120 wild elephants whom the Nepal police shot at on the night of 9 June. The herd had strayed into Nepal at Kalabari area near Naxalbari thus inviting the cruel act on them.
Following the Nepal police firing, the herd returned to the Indian side of the forests and is now camping at the Panighata jungles.
“This evening, while monitoring the herd, we spotted an adult elephant which was limping on its right leg. We suspect it was injured in the Nepal police firing but an affirmation is still waited,” said the Panighata forest range officer Mr Bhupen Biswakarma.
Forest guards at Panighata are using searchlights from a distance to confirm the nature of the injury sustained by the elephant and are also looking for more injured pachyderms, if any.
“But a cent percent confirmation on the injury can be made only by tactfully isolating the injured from the parent herd and that's what the we are attempting now,” a forest official said.
