KOTA KINABALU: An elephant was found dead at an oil palm plantation in Ulu
Segama, Lahad Datu, Eastern Sabah on Monday (July 16).

Sabah Wildlife Department public relation officer Siti Nur'Ain Ampuan Acheh
said the male juvenile pachyderm was discovered by plantation workers at
about 5.10pm Monday.

She said a team of rangers from the Lahad Datu Wildlife Office was
immediately sent to check on the information.

"Upon inspection, the team found that the elephant had an injured foot,
believed due to a snare trap," she said in a statement on Tuesday (July 17).

At least eight elephants have been reported dead due to various reasons in
Sabah between April and July this year. The deaths were reported in the
state's east coast and Lok Kawi Wildlife Park.

As oil palm plantations expand into former forest habitats of elephants,
human-elephant conflicts have become an issue in Sabah.

Elephants are seen as pests by plantation operators as they eat the oil
palm fruits.

Various methods, including electric fences and outright shooting, have been
reported to keep the animals away.

There is the long-standing issue of poaching elephants for the illegal
ivory market.

Elephants are also often caught in snares meant for other animals such as
wild boar and end up dying a slow, painful death from infected wounds.

Sabah Chief Minister Shafie Apdal has announced a greater priority on
wildlife conservation in the state.
