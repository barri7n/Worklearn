As the wild animal lies limp and lifeless on the ground, Nature
Conservation Agency workers collect samples from its body.

The Sumatran elephant was killed after making contact with the electricity
fence of a palm oil plantation in Rantoe Peureulak, Indonesia.

The quickly shrinking habitats of Sumatran elephants has led to clashes
with humans - often because the starving animals stray into human
settlements and destroy crops in their desperate search for food.

The trunked animal has been placed on the list of critically endangered
species after losing half of its population in a single generation.
