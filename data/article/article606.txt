Coimbatore: A female elephant, which reportedly went on the rampage at
Valparai, today collapsed and died, while being chased away by tamed
elephants (Kumki), police said.

The wild elephant's intrusion in the estate area triggered panic over the
last few days and a 62-year-old man was found trampled to death on Saturday
last.

Following an agitation by the villagers, the forest department deployed two
'kumkis' to either capture or chase the elephant into the jungle.

Amid operations, the wild elephant suddenly collapsed while being chased
and died, police said.

The forest officials were contemplating to tranquilise and catch it.

Investigations are on to find the reason for the death, they said.
