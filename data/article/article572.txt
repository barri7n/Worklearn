The female elephant that was found injured in a local forest grove near
Balele in Virajpet taluk of Kodagu, and which was subsequently rescued and
released after treatment last week, was found dead on Tuesday morning.

The elephant had deep wounds — suspectedly inflicted by a wild tusker — and
was partially blind. Post-mortem reports revealed that the injuries were
grievous. Though treated with long-acting antibiotics, the elephant died
owing to septicemia. It had taken refuge in a 12-acre forest close to the
Lakshmantheertha river.

The Forest Department launched a rescue operation with help from
domesticated elephants — Abhimanya, Drone, Krishna, and Bheema from the
Mathigodu camp. After treatment, it was released into the Kalahalla range
of Nagarahole last week. But it walked about 6 km from the spot, crossed
the river, and died near Ganagnur close to Mathigodu.
