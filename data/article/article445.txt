An elephant, which was being driven back into the forest by Forest
department officials and villagers, was electrocuted as it accidentally
came in contact with an electric fence at Hadanuru near Saragur on
Thursday.

The elephant, around 25 years old had strayed into the village,
neighbouring Bandipur range of forests, on Thursday morning and it was
being driven back into the forest. The jumbo first hit a tree, then rammed
the electric fence of the farm of one Rathnajamma. Even as it regained its
balance and started running, its legs got entangled in the cables and got
electrocuted.
