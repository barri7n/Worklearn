NARATHIWAT: Forestry officials and veterinarians tried in vain on Friday to
save a wild elephant wounded by gunshots near an orchard where she had been
looking for food.

Soldiers led a group of officials and animal doctors into the jungle on Mao
Tae mountain in Rangae district after villagers informed security
authorities about the wounded elephant.

They found a female lying on the ground suffering from several gunshot
wounds to her head and left rear leg that had left her unable to stand.

Veterinarians cleaned the wounds and injected a saline solution as part of
the effort to save her life but the elephant finally succumbed to her
injuries.

Villagers told Wirote Siriumakul, the chief of the Chaloem Phrakiat
Wildlife Conservation Office, that the elephant had come down from the
mountain in search of food at a local fruit orchard before she was shot.

The beast had come down with a male elephant and their baby, both of which
returned to the jungle, he added. It is not known who fired the shot at the
animal.

Chonsawad Boonkua, an official with the conservation office, reported the
incident to the Rangae police and asked that they find the shooter.

Villagers who learned of the fate of the elephant took uncooked rice to the
scene and spread it around her to bid their final farewells before she was
laid to rest in the area.
