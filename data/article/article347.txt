An elephant, which seems to be suffering from severe ulcers in and around
its mouth, was seen standing just outside the forest area in Mankarai since
Wednesday morning. Since the forest veterinarian has not been available
throughout the day, none of the forest rangers or public have been able to
approach the animal and help it.

>From the morning, forest watchers in Mankarai, noticed a lone elephant
moving around in the same spot in an agitated manner. "Forest officials and
a couple of conservationists were informed and called a couple of hours
later," said M Siva, wildlife conservationist. "We noticed that the
elephant's mouth seems to be injured due to ulcers and it was not being
able to eat anything," he said.

Conservationists believe the elephant, to be around 18 to 20 years old,
developed ulcers after consuming crops sprayed with fertilizer. "The
chemicals must have reacted and caused ulcers," said Siva.

Though forest officials were informed and have begun watching the elephant
since morning, nobody has approached it yet. "Nobody is available to
tranquilize the animal and examine its injuries," he said.
