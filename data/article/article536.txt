 A five-year-old tusker was electrocuted inside a coffee plantation at
Kunnambetta under Meppadi forest range of South Wayanad forest division on
Tuesday morning.

According to forest officials, the jumbo was found entangled in a snapped
KSEB power line.

South Wayanad divisional forest officer (DFO), Abdul Azeez, said the
elephant, which had strayed into the coffee estate, pulled down an areca
nut tree and it fell on the electric line.

"The electric line fell over the elephant killing it on the spot," he said
adding that the mishap could have occurred in the wee hours of Tuesday. The
estate is situated 1km away from the forest boundary. Meppadi forest range
officer B Harichandran said the elephant was standing in a small stream,
which could have added to the severity of the shock. Postmortem was carried
out by veterinarians of Veterinary university at Pookode.
