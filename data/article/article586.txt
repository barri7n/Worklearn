A famed tusker in the Udawalawe known as 'Hambegamuwe Ethaa' has died after
prolonged illness despite the best efforts of veterinarian to save its life.

The tusker was found while in severe distress on Thursday on the bund of
the Rathambala Wewa in the park's border with Hambegamuwa. The park's
veterinarians immediately began treatment on the elephant, but it passed
away last evening (4).

Veterinary physicians who treated the tusker said the animal had five
bullet wounds in its body as well as several deep cuts. The cuts had become
severely infected and were life threatening, they added.

The tusker was about 40 years of age at the time of death.

According to the census on the countryâ€™s elephant population conducted in
2011, there were only about 120 tuskers left in the wild.
