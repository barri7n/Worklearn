GRIK: A female elephant, believed to be between 15 and 16 years old, died of gunshot wounds in an oil palm plantation in Kampung Pulau Ceri, Lenggong yesterday.

The pachyderm was first captured in the area by Perak Wildlife and National Parks Department (Perhilitan) personnel on Sunday following reports of her presence by plantation workers.

Shortly after her capture, they noticed she was very weak and on closer inspection discovered two bullet wounds and pellet wounds in her forehead.

"We believe she was shot some time ago as the wounds were old and infected," a spokesman said. The bullet wounds were about 60cm deep.

Perhilitan staff tried their best to help the injured animal, but her condition worsened the following day and she died about 12.40pm.

"We had planned to have her transported to Belum forest once her condition improved," he said, adding that the seriously wounded animal had refused to eat.

"She was doing fine in the morning but when she keeled over around noon, we knew that nothing more could be done for her," the spokesman said.

Perhilitan staff, he said, tried to ease her last moments by pouring water on her head to cool her down and pacify her. The animal was buried in the evening where she died.

Department director Shabrina Mohd Shariff said the dead animal had a baby and was separated from a pack of four or five adult elephants.

"We have been monitoring their movement from Sungai Siput to Lenggong since April as we were planning to transport all of them to Belum."

She said that the department believed the animal was shot by villagers or poachers.
