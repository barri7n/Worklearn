An adult male elephant was found dead in the Mohand Forest Range in Saharanpur district on Tuesday night.



While the range has been put on poaching alert, three persons have been arrested as they were seen pulling away the animal.



According to Forest department officials, one tusk of the animal was missing and it had injury marks on its body.

Samples have been sent to the Institute of Veternary Research of India at Bareilly and Wildlife Institute of India for examination.



Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (Wildlife) B K Patnaik said: â€œThough the area where the elephantâ€™s body was found is not a poaching-prone area, we cannot rule out the possibility. But at times, when an animal dies due to some other reason, poachers or even locals can cut its tusks.â€
