RAIPUR: The elephants of Barnawapara Sanctuary have once again strolled out
of the forests in search of food/water at Arang, keeping the Forest
Department on its toes nearly 30 kilometres from the Capital city.

Senior Veterinary of Forest Department Dr Jai Kishore Jadia told ‘The
Hitavada’, one of the calves from the herd has been injured.

The Calf aged around 15 to 20 days has wounds all over the body and
back-right limb has swelling, indicating towards an injury. He had
administered some treatment to the calf, but it then got surrounded by the
herd of 17 elephants at Chaprid (Gullu).

It’s impossible to go anywhere near to injured baby elephant now. On Friday
night, villagers had rescued the baby when it fell in a ditch. Since the
calf is surrounded by his family, they can only watch it from a safe
distance.

Entire field staff, officials of Raipur and Mahasamund Range along with the
police personnel are on watch 500 meters from the herd and will stay on
guard till the jumbos go back to sanctuary.

The herd is peaceful like always, however, real trouble makers are the
villagers swarming the spot and defying the expert advice of maintaining
safe distance.

These elephants have made the Barnawapara their home for past few years and
they often stroll out of the park in search of water/food and return
without causing any harm to anyone, but just crops.

According to the information, villagers spotted the herd at Samoda coming
from the direction of Mahasamund on Saturday and quickly reported the
Forest Officials.

Team of Forest Department and Police stopped the herd from entering the
populated areas.
