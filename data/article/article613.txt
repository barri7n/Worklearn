A tusker was found dead near Hosahalli in Sakleshpur taluk on Tuesday.

The reason for death is unknown.

Officers of Sakleshpur range reached the spot after they learnt about the
death of the elephant from locals. M.L. Manjunath, Deputy Conservator of
Forests, said the death seems to be of natural causes, but tests would be
conducted to ascertain this. Those who visited the spot said the carcass
had begun decaying, suggesting that the tusker died a few days ago.
