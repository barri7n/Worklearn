Another elephant, a single tusker, was found shot dead at the Sellankandal
Forest Reserve in Puttalam yesterday, wildlife officials said.

They said that they suspect the elephant could be around 30-years old and
might have been killed a day before yesterday.

A man who had gone to the forest to graze his cow had seen the elephant
carcass and had informed the wildlife officials.

They said several gunshot wounds had been detected on the carcass.

The autopsy into the elephantâ€™s death is expected to be conducted today.
