SILIGURI: With the winter cold intensifying, north Bengal is witnessing one
after another poaching or mystery deaths of wild animals.

In the latest case, an adult wild elephant has been found dead at Bengdubi
forest near Bagdogra in Siliguri today morning. It was a tusker of around
10-years-old.

The location where the elephant has been found dead, is not very far from
the Bengdubi base of the Indian Army. It comes under Kurseong forest
division.

On receiving information from people living in nearby villagers, a team of
foresters went to the spot and retrieved the carcass for post-mortem.

It is not yet clear as to how the wild animal has died but the possibility
of an attack by poachers to steal its tusks has not been ruled out.

This is the fourth wild animal death in north Bengal since 25 December. On
the day of Christmas, a rhino was found dead in Jaldapara Wildlife
Sanctuary.

This was followed by the recovery of the carcasses of two wild leopards
from Gargenda tea garden in Alipurduar district on 26 and 27 December.
