DALTONGANJ: The forest guards of south division of Palamau Tiger Reserve
have spotted an injured adult elephant in the Burha Pahar range but can't
do much to help it unless the jumbo leaves the rebel-infested area on its
own.

The elephant, which was spotted on Thursday, has an injury on its right
hind leg that it finds difficult to put down.

The cause of the injury is yet to be ascertained.

M.K. Mahaling, deputy director of the south division of PTR, no forest
guard can enter the Burha Pahar range, dotted with Maoist landmines,
without the permission of the security forces.

He said the guards were waiting for the elephant to co-me back to the safe
zone of PTR where Ajay Kumar, a doctor of Bhagwan Birsa Biological Park in
Ormanjhi, has been requested to come over to examine it.

"We don't know about the nature or condition of the wound except that the
elephant is down with serious problem in its right hind leg," Mahaling
added.

Sources said one PTR elephant had succumbed to its injuries that it had
sustained in a land mine explosion last year.
