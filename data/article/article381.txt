NEW DELHI (AP) â€” As their forest habitats shrink and villages edge closer,
it's not uncommon for wild elephants in India to destroy crops and homes
and sometimes even kill people.

Sometimes, coming too close to civilization leads to tragic consequences
for the pachyderms.

In remote parts of the northeastern state of Assam elephants are sometimes
run over by speeding trains.

An elephant was killed early Wednesday when a tree he had uprooted to eat
fell on an electric tower in the Goalpara region of Assam. Villagers said
the rest of the herd of 20-25 elephants tried to help but were scared by
the jolts of power and finally had to abandon the animal.

Devout Hindus also worship elephants as an incarnation of the
elephant-headed God Ganesha. As news of the elephant's death spread, dozens
of villagers poured out to pay their respects to the animal.
