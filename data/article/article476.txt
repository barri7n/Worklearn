A female elephant shot by a villager after going with her family to eat
fruit at mountainside orchards in Narathiwatâ€™s Ra Ngae district last week
has died of her injuries, officials said yesterday.

 The wounded mammal was found Thursday near a creek by Maotae Mountain in
Tambon Mareu Botok, 200 metres from Ban Bra Eng Moo 2.

Chaloem Phra Kiat Sirinthon Wildlife Sanctuary head Wiroj Siri-umakul and
chief of the 45th Ranger Regiment, Colonel Isara Janthakrayom, then called
in a vet from Protected Area Regional Office 6 (Songkhla) to treat the
elephant, whose head and broken left hind leg were riddled with shotgun
wounds.
