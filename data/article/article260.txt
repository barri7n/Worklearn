In a joint operation, forest officials and paramilitary forces in India's eastern state of West Bengal arrested two poachers and seized 24 lbs. of ivory. 
 
The operation was conducted in Jaldapara National Park in West-Bengal. 
 
On Tuesday forest officials discovered a slain adult elephant with missing tusks in Chipra forest in nearby Buxa Tiger Reserve. 
 
Acting on a tip the joint operation team posed as customers and laid a trap for the poachers. 
 
Five of the seven poachers succeeded in escaping and officials are currently following leads and investigating the matter. 
 
Recently there has been a surge in the demand for Elephant ivory, which is used to treat liver cancer. 
 
Experts have repeatedly said that massive deforestation, poaching and encroachment in forest corridors force the elephants to move out of their natural habitats in search of food and water, making them an easy target. 
 
India has over 50 percent of the world's Asiatic elephant population. But their numbers have been dwindling in recent years.
