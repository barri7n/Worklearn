Two wild elephants were electrocuted as they encountered live electric wire
in Lohagora upazila of Chittagong early Saturday.

Locals set up electric fences around their paddy field and the two
elephants—a mother and her calf – accidentally came in contact with wire.

A police complaint was lodged with Lohagora Police Station in this
connection this evening, our Chittagong staff correspondent reports.

Lohagara Police Station Officer-in-Charge Mohammed Shahjahan told The Daily
Star: “The line was set up to hunt wild pig. We were investigating the
matter. Legal action will be taken in this regard.”
