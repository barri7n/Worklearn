BERHAMPUR: An elephant calf was found dead near Karada forest in Kandhamal
district on Thursday. The postmortem of the calf, aged less than a year,
was done, a day after its death on Friday, as four elephants, including the
mother, did not allow the forest officials to go to the spot.

"We waited the whole day but could not venture near the spot as the herd
guarded the carcass," said divisional forest officer (Phulbani) Prakash
Chand Gogineni. Efforts of the forest staff to drive away the elephants
from the spot also failed.

A group of tribals had informed the forest officials about the carcass. He
said the exact cause of death could not be ascertained. There was no
visible injury mark on the carcass.

"The reason of the death would be known only after we get the postmortem
report," said the DFO.
