Dhaka - An elephant was killed in Bangladesh by an electrified fence built 
to protect crops as he mourned the death of a herd member electrocuted by 
the same barrier, an official said on Thursday.

One elephant was killed on Monday by the fence erected by locals to keep the 
elephants from destroying rice crops, a forest officer said.

The second was electrocuted on Tuesday as it returned with a herd of more 30 
to the spot and dug up the body of the first elephant buried by forest 
staff.

"They were mourning the death of their beloved mate. It's a very sad thing 
but it shows the strong tie of friendship among those wild animals," said 
divisional forest officer Abdul Latif Mia.

'They were mourning the death of their beloved mate'
The two elephants were killed in Sherpur district near the border with 
India's Meghalaya state.

Scientists believe elephants mourn their dead.

In May around 100 elephants were reported to have wailed loudly for three 
days after one of their herd was killed by poachers in south-eastern 
Bangladesh.

Elephants frequently damage property and crops in north-eastern India and 
Bangladesh, where loss of their natural habitat to population encroachment 
has brought them into conflict with humans.

Villagers have also been killed trying to protect their homes and crops from 
elephants.
