RISHIKESH: Suspected poachers allegedly killed a male elephant in the
Shivalik forests of Uttarakhand and made away with its twin tusks,
officials said Monday.

Acting District Forest Officer Dharma Singh Meena said the 45-year-old
tusker's body, which does not bear any external injury mark, is being sent
for a post-mortem to ascertain how it was killed.

However, the removal of its tusks makes it look like a case of illegal
poaching, the DFO said.

It appears poachers killed the tusker not far from the forest checkpost in
the Thano range of Dehradun forest division late Sunday evening and made
away with its twin tusks, he said.

Forest and Special Task Force personnel have stepped up vigilance in the
wake of the incident, he said.
