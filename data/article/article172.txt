7.1.2011 (UNI) Karnataka High Court today issued notice to the Centre and Karnataka government, returnable in four weeks, on the steps taken to prevent death of elephants due to electrification of fences in agriculture fields.

Chief Justice Khehar directed both the governments to study the report submitted by a Committee appointed, on a suo-motu petition and come out with measures it intends to take to prevent recurrence of elephant deaths.

The Committee, comprising wildlife and forest officials, was appointed by the Court last year following reports of death of elephants in the state either due to electrocution or shooting down of pachyderms which stray into agricultural fields and destroy the crops.

Meanwhile, in the last two days, three elephant calves were electrocuted in an agricultural field at Hassan, about 200 km from here. Two calves-an 18 nonth-old male calf and a five month-old female calf, were killed in the incident of Vatepur in Alur Taluk in Hassan District. This morning one more calf was killed due to electrocution.

Officials, however, stated that there was no fencing and the mishap could have been due to faulty earthing of a motor fitted in an agricultural field. The cause of the death would be known after post mortem.
