An injured elephant was saved by rescuers after it was found lying in a
pool of mud with a nail hammered into its leg in Sri Lanka.

The animal was comforted by villagers in Kottukachchiya, Sri Lanka, after
they found it lying helplessly near a jungle.

The heartwarming footage shows scores of locals plying the elephant with
fruit and washing its wounds in a desperate attempt to save him.

It is not yet clear whether the elephant was injured by poachers.

Dr Isuru Hewa Kottage said: 'The tusker's health condition is serious but
we are doing everything to save him.

'We are giving him medicines and saline water. The wound is deep.'

Last year, Sri Lanka became the first South Asian country to destroy
valuable tusks that were smuggled out after killing majestic elephants.
