JORHAT: An elephant calf was injured in the Deusur area of Kaziranga National Park after being hit by a bus on NH-37 early on Friday. Forest department officials said the incident took place when a herd of jumbos was crossing the highway.

"Although the other jumbos in the herd crossed the road safely, the calf got hit by the bus and was injured," said Burapahar forest range officer I Majid.

He added that they tried to get hold of the injured elephant calf, but other jumbos of the herd posed a hurdle. Animals getting hit by vehicles on NH-37 is nothing new as there are several reports of such incidents in the recent past.

As a part of the national highway falls inside the park, the animals cross the road both during daytime and night.

Last year, an elephant calf and a leopard were knocked down on the highway while the animals were trying to cross the road.

Every monsoon, when floodwaters submerge vast swathes of Kaziranga, the animals cross the road to go to nearby Karbi Anglong hills. During that time, park authorities restrict the speed of vehicles passing through the highway.
