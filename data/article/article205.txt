Ramnagar (Uttarakhand), Sep.15 (ANI): A 20-year-old elephant was found dead by forest authorities at the Sarpduli Range in the Jim Corbett National Park in Uttarakhand with injuries on his ears and trunk.

The elephant was found dead under mysterious circumstances on Wednesday.

The forest superintendent of the Sarpduli Range, R.

K. Mishra, said they are yet to determine the cause of the death.

"Blood was oozing out from his ear and trunk, so definitely it is an injury. The cause of the injury would be known only after the post mortem report comes," said Mishra.

Forest officials said there were no other signs of injury on any other part of the body.

A 40-year-old elephant had died under mysterious circumstances in a farmland in the state a day earlier.

India has over 50 per cent of Asiatic elephants, considered to be among the most intelligent animals, but their population has dwindled in the recent years. In the last ten years, around 30 elephants died due to electrocution in eastern Indian states.
