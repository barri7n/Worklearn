Idukki: The carcass of a two-year-old elephant was found at a eucalyptus
plantation near the tribal settlement colony at Kundala Sandoz in Munnar on
Sunday morning.

The postmortem was conducted by Periyar Tiger Reserve assistant forest
veterinary officer Dr Abdul Fathah in the presence of Munnar assistant
field conservator Harichandaran and Devikulam range officer Nibu Kiran on
Sunday.

"Herpes simplex, a virus infection that affects the immune system, might
have resulted in the animal's death. We will send internal organs of the
calf to Palod chief investigation office for further analysis. The carcass
was burnt later," said a forest department official.

Last Monday, an elephant calf was also found dead at the eucalyptus
plantation. Seven wild elephant deaths were reported in and around Munnar
for the past four months. Of this, three wild elephants were found to be
murdered.

Elephant attacks on humans are also being frequently reported in Munnar and
Marayoor forest divisions. On Friday, a hotel worker was trampled to death
by a wild elephant at Suryanelli.
