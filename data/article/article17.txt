Man's animal instincts leave elephant injured and blind

Dhaka, Mar 5 (UNI) Human instincts are sometimes more deadly for animals 
than vice versa, as exemplified by the ''bestial'' attack by a mob on an 
elephant in Bangladesh's southeastern Cox's Bazar district.

Th mob attacked the wild elephant, who entered the area in search of food, 
with hot iron rods and powdered chilli on Wednesday, injuring and blinding 
him.

Large amounts of chilli powder were thrown into the helpless animal's eyes 
with the sole purpose of selling its parts and with total disregard for the 
consequences.

After the brutal attack, the nearly-blind animal slipped into a pond. Later, 
the elephant clambered up and crashed into trees repeatedly as it moved 
blindly to and fro, wailing in pain.

Local people of the coastal area, anguished by the elephant's suffering, 
expressed the apprehension that the elephant could die within a short time 
and the miscreants were just biding their time.

Forest officials said the injured elephant moved into the deep forest on 
Thursday, but could not say anything about its present condition.

Meanwhile, three elephants were killed by hunters in Ramu and nearby 
Naikhangchhari sub-district in the last two weeks.

It was probably incidents like these which were on Mahatma Gandhi's mind 
when he said ''the more helpless a creature, the more entitled it is to 
protection by man from the cruelty of man.''
