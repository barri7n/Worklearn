KOTA TINGGI: An adult female elephant died after the startled animal
charged a trailer at Batu 13 along the Jalan Mersing-Kota Tinggi road here.

Johor Department of Wildlife and National Parks (Perhilitan) director
Jamalun Nasir Ibrahim said the incident occurred near the Panti forest
reserve at around 2am on Monday morning (May 21).

He said initial investigations found that the incident happened when the
driver of another car turned on the high beam of his headlights when he saw
a herd of elephants crossing the road.

“This startled one of the elephants and it was hit by a trailer which was
travelling from Terengganu to Singapore. The elephant died at the scene and
was less than ten years old,” said Jamalun.

He advised any road users not to provoke animals by honking or turning on
their high beam to avoid startling the animal and provoking it to attack.

Kota Tinggi OCPD Supt Ashmon Bajah confirmed that the incident took place
and said the driver did not suffer any injuries.
