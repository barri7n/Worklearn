KOLABIRA: Despite treatment for the last three days, a terminally ill
elephant died at Malatitikra under Kolabira forest range in Jharsuguda
Wednesday.

A team comprising divisional forest officer Sushant Kumar, assistant
conservator of forest Saroj Panda and veterinary officer Dr Salini Sethy
conducted some tests before confirming the elephantâ€™s death.

The carcass was buried after post-mortem.

According to local residents, one of the legs of the elephant, aged 50, was
short due to polio.

This deformity along with sickness restricted its movement to a great
extent. It also stopped taking food.

Three days ago, it got stuck in the mud at a paddy field on the side of
Chandanimal river while coming out of Mahulamunda forest.

The forest officials after trying several methods succeeded in getting the
elephant out of the swamp Sunday. But the effort made the elephant weak and
it died Wednesday.
