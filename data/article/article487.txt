A 35-year-old elephant was electrocuted after it came in contact with 11 KV
live wire near Aluajharan under Kamakshyanagar (West) reserve forest on
Sunday.
The incident occurred when the tusker was crossing paddy field on the
forest route. Locals informed the matter to forest officials who rushed to
the spot and started investigation. The officials said some miscreants had
laid live wire to trap wild boars and on Sunday, the elephant came in
contact with the wire and got electrocuted.

Locals, however, alleged that the officials of forest department have
failed to nab the mafia who are involved in poaching activities for
consumption and sale. The carcass has been sent for post-mortem.

Divisional Forest Officer (DFO) PK Sahoo said investigation is on to arrest
the culprits involved in the incident.
