A four-tonne elephant was fat  ally electrocuted at a corn field near the
Salakpra Wildlife Sanctuary in Kanchanaburi's Muang district on Monday
morning when it separated from its herd to hunt for food.

Sanctuary head Paitoon Intharabut went to the corn field in Tambon Chong
Sadao along with a veterinarian and police when the wild elephantâ€™s death
was reported at 8.30am. They found the 25-year-old male bull lying with its
stomach on electrical wires.

Corn farmer Wutthichot Rojanaphokhapreeda, 48, told police that he
installed the 220-volt electrical wire fence around his 12-rai cornfield on
August 28 to protect the crop from cows and buffaloes but he failed to
report the wire installation to park officials.

He said that he only released 110 volts of electricity and a wild elephant
previously tried to eat his crop but got a shock and ran away.

Paitoon said officials would proceed with legal action against the farmer
as installing the electrical wire resulting in a wild elephant's death was
within the frame of illegal wildlife hunting.
