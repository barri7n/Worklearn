SILIGURI, June 22: Yet another Indian wild elephant was killed in Nepal. This time, it's a 40-year old female pachyderm that has succumbed to bullet injuries allegedly inflicted by the Nepal police in the eastern district of Jhapa adjacent to the Siliguri sub-division.
According to Ms Sumita Ghatak, the divisional forest officer, Mahananda Wildlife Division - I in Siliguri, a herd of nearly 80 Indian elephants had strayed into Nepal from the Kalabari forests near Naxalbari in Siliguri last night but were brought back by the authorities in the neighbouring country.
"Early this morning, the locals discovered the dead body of an adult pachyderm at Bamundangi area on the Nepal side and informed us. The carcass bore several bullet injuries on its forehead and other parts of the body. We have informed the senior officials in state forest department about the incident,” Ms Ghatak said.
The spot, where the elephant carcass was found today, is located barely at a 100-metre distance from the Bamundangi police station in Nepal.
Local residents claim they had heard a massive gunfire last night and discovered the carcass today.
“Since, the Nepal Maoists have laid down the arms, it is the Nepal police and other security agencies there, who are shooting wild elephants,” alleged Mr Sujit Das of the Nature and Adventure Society, Oodlabari.
On 18 June, an Indian wild elephant calf was electrocuted at the Bamundangi area again, after coming in contact with a high-tension electric wire planted by villagers.
Expressing his worry over the killing of Indian pachyderms in Nepal, the state forest minister, Mr Ananta Roy today said that he would raise the matter with the chief minister soon and urge him to report the issue to the Union government.
