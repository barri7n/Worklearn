BARGAON:  An adult tusker was Sunday found battling for life following
critical injuries on its trunk and foot in Rajgangpur jungle under Bargaon
forest range in Sundargarh district.

Villagers living on the fringes of the forest noticed the animal limping
with great pain and eating leaves by kneeling on the ground a few months
back. The tusker is part of a herd from Jharkhand which has been straying
into the district for the last two years. The injury was noticed when it
strayed into Dahijira jungle a few months ago.

With its condition remaining critical, the pachyderm is slowly inching
towards death in the absence of treatment. The bottom part of its trunk was
found hanging as the injury has become septic.

It is apprehended, that the bottom part of the trunk might get detached
from the body anytime.

The villagers demanded the immediate intervention of forest officials for
its treatment. They claimed that the animal has also a deep injury on its
foot after it possibly stamped on a broken liquor bottle thrown by
picnickers in the forest.

However, the actual reason behind the injury on its trunk is yet to be
ascertained.
