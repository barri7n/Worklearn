January 9, 2014 Keonjhar: A forester and a guard were suspended on Wednesday for dereliction of duty. They allegedly burnt the carcass of a tusker in Nayagarh reserve forest, about 55 km from here, and buried it without conducting a postmortem on Sunday. Sources said the elephant died about two weeks ago. The animal had a bullet wound near its ear and the tusks were missing. "We have sent the carcass for postmortem. We will initiate further action after getting the field report," said DFO (Keonjhar) Rohit Kumar Lenka. It was yet to be confirmed if poachers had killed the elephant. Article at the following link:
