CUTTACK: A pregnant elephant was electrocuted at Suniamuha village under Athagarh forest division in the district on Sunday. 
 
The 40-year-old pachyderm, which was in her advanced stages of pregnancy, had entered the premises of a sponge iron unit and died after it came in contact with a high tension live wire. Her 20-month-old foetus also died on the spot. 
 
Forest officials rushed to the spot and started an inquiry. They said the company had not constructed any boundary wall. As a result, the elephant managed to enter the factory premises easily. 
 
"When the elephant entered the factory premises, some electric motors were in use and the pachyderm came in contact with a live wire," said divisional forest officer (Athagarh) Arun Mishra. An FIR has been lodged against the owner of the company for negligence. However, the factory owner went into hiding. 
 
"We have sealed the factory and filed an FIR against the factory owner under Wildlife Protection Act," said Mishra. Earlier in January, an elephant calf was found dead in Narsinghpur forest. 
 
According to 2012 census, the elephant population in Athagarh forest division stands at 131. Locals have alleged that wild elephants have been moving out of the forests as factory owners have encroached on jumbo corridors. 
 
"In the last two decades, many factories have come up in Athagarh area affecting the habitat of elephants," said Sunakar Rout, a senior citizen.
