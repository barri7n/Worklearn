A male elephant was electrocuted after coming into contact with an illegal
high voltage electrified fence put up around a farm in the Sathyamangalam
Tiger Reserve (STR) in this district, Forest officials said today.

The pachyderm, believed to be 11 years old, was found dead yesterday in
Neithalapuram village near Thalawady and a veterinarian declared it had
died of electrocution, officials said.

A case had been registered against the farm owner, Karuppana Gounder, who
is reportedly absconding, they said.

Some farmers in forest fringes put up such fences, which are illegal, to
prevent wild animals from damaging crops.

Though rules permit energising fences with low voltage to give a mild shock
to animals to prevent them from entering farms, often the farmers resort to
installing 230 volt fencing, which result in fatalities.

There have been several incidents in Tamil Nadu in the past of elephants
and other animals being electrocuted after coming into contact with such
fences.

In some instances, farm owners have been arrested.
