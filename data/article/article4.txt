Bandar Lampung, Lampung, Jan 29 (ANTARA) - A number of environmental 
activists in Indonesia's Lampung province have urged concerned agencies to 
look into the killing of four elephants at the Bukit Barisan National Park, 
a spokesman has said.

The remains of the four elephants (elephas maximus sumatrensis, sp) were 
found near the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) research center within 
the premises of the park in Bengkunat subdistrict, West Lampung district, 
executive director of the non-governmental organization, WATALA, Joko 
Santoso said here Thursday.

The call to investigate the killing of the elephants has already been 
conveyed by WATALA, the Lampung Forest Conservation Consortium, the 
Indonesian Alas Foundation and WCS to the provincial administration, he 
said.

Joko said poachers have been killing such endangered animals as 
rhinoceroses, tigers and elephants and have been stealing parts of their 
bodies for money.

WCS researchers who found the remains of the four elephants saw that their 
tusks were missing, he said.

Joko said researchers sometimes hear gunshots as they do their tasks at the 
park.

Head of the park's management office, Tamen Sitorus, confirmed the death of 
the four elephants.

"Four elephants have died of illegal hunting," he said, adding that about 
600 elephants live at the national park.
