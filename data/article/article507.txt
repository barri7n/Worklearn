The carcass of a sub-adult female elephant was found in an agriculture
field near Garda village under Bisra range of Rourkela Forest Division on
Wednesday. The elephant is suspected to have been electrocuted.

Divisional Forest Officer (DFO) Sanjeet Kumar said, the female elephant may
have come into contact with the 44 KV overhead line and died. It appears
that the overhead wires were sagging and the elephantâ€™s trunk got
entangled, he said adding autopsy of the carcass would be conducted on
Thursday.

The villagers of Garda, part of Nuagaon block, prevented the forest
officials from shifting the carcass demanding safety measures in place from
a herd of eight elephants which has holed up at adjacent Bandega Reserve
Forest (RF). They also demanded immediate payment of all outstanding
compensation claims of elephant depredations.

Assistant Conservator of Forest JK Mohanty said, efforts were underway to
convince the villagers to relent. A squad would guard the carcass during
night while another would chase away the herd.  With this, the number of
elephant casualties in Rourkela division has reached four in six months. An
elephant calf died on October 6, 2016 after it got stuck in a puddle near
Sonaparvat under Panposh range. The same day, another newborn died after
drowning in an open well at Riu of Kuarnmunda range.

On September 2, 2016 a sub-adult tusker had died of accidental poisoning on
a farm field at Angarpara village under Banki range.
