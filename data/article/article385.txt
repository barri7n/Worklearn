A tusker was found dead with three gunshot wounds at a farm near Magodu
village in Arakalgud taluk on Tuesday. During the post-mortem of the
25-year-old elephant, veterinarians found two pellets. However, the tusk
was intact.

Residents of the village found the carcass early in the morning and
informed the forest officers. A team of officers, led by Ganesh Bhat,
Deputy Conservator of Forests, reached the spot. The post-mortem concluded
that the death was due to gunshots.

“It seems like the animal was shot at from close range, probably from an
elevated position. It has three major wounds on its neck and forehead,” Mr.
Ganesh Bhat told The Hindu .

The Forest Department has registered a case.
