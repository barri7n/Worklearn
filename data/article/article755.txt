One of the largest elephants in Kala Wewa National Park, also the leader of
a herd, has been killed after being attacked by a tusker.

Camera footage had caught nearly 300 elephants were seen paying their last
respect to the leader yesterday (16).

The deceased elephant had reportedly engaged in a conflict with a tusker
roaming around Kala Wewa, for several days, according to the Wildlife
Officers.

After being critically attacked by the tusker, the leader of the herd had
died yesterday.

Nearly two herds of elephants, including elephant calves, had arrived at
the location, to grieve the dead herd leader.

Wildlife Officers stated that the elephants of a herd take protective
measures to protect their leader when they sense an imminent danger, and
such incidents are a rare sight to be witnessed.

The tusker which killed the leader of the elephant herd had returned to
attack the deceased elephant once the rest of the elephants had left the
area, said Wildlife Officers.

Meanwhile, an elephant calf, believed to be nearly 5-years-old, has died
after consuming Hakka Patas (a crude home-made explosive used for killing
wild elephants) near Yan Oya in Kahatagasdigiliya, Anuradhapura.
