SURAT THANI â€• Park officials on Tuesday said they are investigating the death of a wild female elephant believed to have been electrocuted and killed on an orchard near Tai Rom Yen National Park in Kanchanadit district.



The dead elephant was found by the road side adjacent to an orchard around 300 metres from one of the six national parks in Surat Thani province. A team of park officials and veterinarians found a wooden pole wrapped with a 200-Volt electric wire in a shack about five metres from the animal, park chief Pichet Chaisawat said.



Similar wooden poles wrapped with electrical wire were erected around the orchard, creating a fence to ward off wild elephants from trespassing and eating crops.



Anurak Boonchareon, the orchard's owner, said he found the dead elephant in the morning, but denied he put up the electric fence on the premises.



It is estimated that the pachyderm was aged between 25 and 30 and weighed about 1.5 tonnes.



Experts will examine tissue samples, stools and food remains from the elephant's stomach to identify the cause of death, Mr Pichet said, adding that the process would take seven days.
