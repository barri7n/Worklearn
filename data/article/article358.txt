Carcasses of five elephants with their tusks removed have been found in
Kerala's Malayatoor forest, prompting officials to order a probe.

The carcasses were found two days ago. A team of forest officials visited
the spot and examined the elephant remains, a senior Forest Division
official told PTI today.

Only after a probe will it be known how the tuskers died, the official
said, adding that the tusks of all the elephants were found removed.

Meanwhile, V K Venkatachalam of Elephant Heritage Task Force said killing
of elephants for ivory had been going on in the state since over a year.

"In the last one-and-half years, around 32 tuskers have been killed and
their remains found with tusks removed," he said.

"We had earlier brought this matter to the Wildlife Crime Control Bureau,
New Delhi, and also to the Chief Wildlife Warden, Kerala," he said.

Following the complaint, a team of officials from the Chennai unit of the
bureau had conducted a detailed probe in January this year, he added.
