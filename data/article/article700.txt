CUTTACK: Forest officials on Tuesday found a carcass of a tusker from the
Gopapur forest in the Kalima Reserve Forest under the Badamba Range with
the tusks having been stolen by poachers.

The forest officials said the tusker had been killed 10 to 12 days back by
the poachers. It is the second incident within a week in which the poachers
have been successful in killing elephants and taking away their tusks.

Sources said the forest officials were trying hard to hide the matter and
were not receiving phone calls. It might be mentioned that earlier on
February 20, carcass of a tusker was also found and its tusks were stolen.

Locals alleged that though another such incident has been occurred twice in
close intervals, the higher authorities are still unvigilant in the matter.
