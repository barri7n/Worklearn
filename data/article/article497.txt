Villagers living on the fringe of Ang Ruenai wildlife sanctuary in the
borders and Chanthaburi and Chachoengsao provinces not to set snare traps
to harm intruding elephants after forest officials found and destroyed
eight traps in the forest.

Last Thursday, forest rangers and a veterinarian managed to free one
elephant caught in a snare trap in Ang Ruenai wildlife sanctuary. The jumbo
suffered serious cut in its trunk and was treated with anti-biotics before
it was released into the wild.

Mr Decha Nilvichien, chief of the wildlife sanctuary, said on Sunday that
there are about 50 elephants foraging for food on the border of the
sanctuary and may have intruded into villagersâ€™ farmland.

Because of the huge number of the elephants, he admitted that it was
difficult for forest rangers to try to drive his herd deep into the jungle
away from the farmland.

Nevertheless, he said officials had been assigned to monitor the herd and,
at the same time, other officials were sent to explain to the villagers
about what they should do for their safety and the safety of the animals.

Besides telling them not to set snare traps, the park chief said villagers
were instructed not to set fire crackers to scare away the animals because
they might become excited and hurt the villagers.
