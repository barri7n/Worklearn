The putrefied carcass of a full grown female elephant was found at Moraghat
range of Dooars today.

The carcass was sighted lying near Kalapani river by forest workers during
a routine visit, Wildlife warden Seema Chowdhury said.

It was, however, yet to be known when the elephant died, Chowdhury, who
visited the sport along with Jalpaiguri district forest officer Bidyut
Sarkar said.

Meanwhile, wildlife NGOs here have alleged laxity by forest department as
the carcass was not sighted during the three-day elephant census that ended
on March 29.

Sarkar said the allegation will be looked into.

West Bengal Forest Minister Benoy Krishna Burman said the elephant had died
of old age
