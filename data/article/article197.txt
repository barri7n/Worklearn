A wild elephant was found dead in a coconut estate at Siraminiadiya in Puttalam.  Wildlife conservation officers who examined the carcass said that the well grown jumbo was about 8ft tall and had been between 23 to 30 years of age. The veterinary surgeon of the North Western Wildlife Zone, Dr Chandana Jayasinghe who performed the postmortem said the jumbo had died of poisoning. He said 45 wild elephants in the North Western Zone had been either shot dead or killed by poisoning over the last five months of this year. He said he found a deadly poison in the stomach contents of the dead animal which was lying in a coconut estate belonging to an Ayurvedic product manufacturing company. The Asst. Wildlife Ranger in Karuwalagaswewa was seeking a court order to arrest the suspects.
