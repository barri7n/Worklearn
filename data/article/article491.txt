An elephant calf died after it was rescued by a team of Kaziranga National
Park and forest officials from the Bhomoraguri Reserve Forest here, a
forest official said on Tuesday.

The two-year-old elephant was tranquilized and safely rescued, but it died
in a vehicle on way to the rescue centre yesterday, Rathin Barman, Director
of the Elephant Rescue Centre of the Wildlife Trust of India at KNP, said.

The baby elephant was severely injured in the stomach as confirmed by the
post-mortem, Mr Barman said.

West Sonitpur Divisional Forest Officer (DFO) Diganta Borbora said the
elephant had crossed the river Brahmputra from the Kaziranga National Park
(KNP) and took shelter in the Bhomoraguri Reserve Forest before it was
traced on Sunday.

According to the rescue team, they guarded the pachyderm in the night
before it was tranquilized in the morning yesterday.
