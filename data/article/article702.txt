Forest officials on Tuesday found the carcass of a tusker from the
Haladiaseni Reserve Forest under the Badamba Range. The tusks of the
elephant were stolen by the poachers.

Sources said the poachers had killed the pachyderm ten days ago and stolen
its tusks. After recovering the carcass, Athagarh DFO Arun Kumar Swain, ACF
Rajendra Das and Badamba Ranger Govinda Chandra Ratha had directed for
holding of an autopsy of the animal.

Veterinary Surgeon Dr Nihar Ranjan Dash, after the autopsy, said several
injury marks were spotted on the body of the tusker and more details about
its death could be ascertained after release of the viscera report.

However, locals alleged that as no forest patrolling is being done in the
Athagarh Forest Division since long, not only animals but also the entire
jungle is now in the grip of the mafias and poachers.

They also alleged that some unscrupulous forest officials are hands in
glove with the mafias and poachers in loot of the jungle and death of
animals.

The locals pointed out that if the forest is not guarded, the innocent
animals like deer, wild boars and hares would continue to be easy prey to
the poachers. They demanded that the higher authorities remain vigilant in
the matter.
