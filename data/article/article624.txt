Jharsuguda: Even as the man-elephant conflict is growing every day, a baby
elephant died after falling into a trench on Thursday night. The trench was
dug up for railway work in Telidihi under Bagadihi forest range in
Jharsuguda.

After receiving information, forest department personnel reached the spot,
rescued the pachydermâ€™s body and sent it for postmortem.

Sources at the forest department said the baby elephant, which is believed
to be a five-month-old, might have fallen into the trench accidentally when
it came along with a herd last night to graze crops.
