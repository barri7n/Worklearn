A four-year-old male elephant was found dead in Sirumugai forest range
in Coimbatore on Monday. This is reportedly the seventh wild elephant
died in forests of Coimbatore this year.

Forest Department officials said that the elephant calf was found in
weak condition in the backwater area of Bhavani Sagar dam at
Pethikutti section of Koothamundi North beat of Sirumugai range.

“Forest staff found the elephant struggling to get up from the place.
Later it walked up to the waterhole and drank water. Senior veterinary
surgeon N.S. Manoharan was informed about the elephant. Unfortunately,
the calf walked barely 30 metres from the water body and died while
the medical team was to leave for the location,” said District Forest
Officer S. Ramasubramanian.

The dead calf was part of an elephant herd that was roaming the
location. The herd spent some time with the dead elephant and
returned.

Mr. Ramasubramanian said that the reason for the death could be
ascertained only after the post-mortem. The carcass will be autopsied
on Tuesday morning by Dr. Manoharan.
