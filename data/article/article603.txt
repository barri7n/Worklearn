BHIMDATTANAGAR: A group of poachers killed an elephant at Punarbas
Municipality-10 in Kanchanpur on Thursday night, said the District Forest
Office.

Acting forest officer at the DFO Bir Bahadur Thagunna confirmed that the
elephant was killed by laying a trap inside the local Namuna Community
Forest.

Following the incident, a team from the DFO is investigating into the
incident. "A preliminary report shows that the poachers planted the trap to
catch a boar, but the male elephant got trapped instead," said Thagunna.

the poachers has been launched, he added.
