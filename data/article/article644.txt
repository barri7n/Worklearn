Idukki: The death of the female elephant at Devikulam was due to
electrocution, said the post-mortem report. In connection with the case, S
Yovan (53), a worker of Kannan Devan Hills Plantation Limited, was arrested.

The body of the pregnant elephant was found on the grasslands of the Kannan
Devan Hill Plantations (KDHP) Estate Devikulam factory division on Monday
morning. The body was found to be touching the fencing of the area.

The wild elephant had been destroying Yovan's agricultural goods regularly.
Then he decided to connect electricity to the fencing to prevent the wild
elephant attack.

"The death of the female elephant was due to electrocution. The accused
already admitted it," said Munnar DFO Narendra Babu.

Meanwhile, a herd of wild elephants reached the Devikulam factory division
area on Monday night, creating panic in the area. Over 14 wild elephants
reached the spot where the female elephant died due to electrocution.

The wild elephants destroyed agricultural goods in the area. During the
last four months, over six wild elephants have died at Munnar and Marayoor.
