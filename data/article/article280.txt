Electrocution of an elephant last week in Tabada-Abthulia forest has exposed the negligence of Forest and Electricity department officials in repairing sagging overhead live electric wires.



Forest department officials and wildlife activists had found the carcass of the elephant in a paddy field in Tabada village on Tuesday.



Villagers said the poachers had laid a trap in the paddy field for hunting wild animals for meat and the elephant might have come in contact with the live wire.



Sources said six elephants have fallen prey to deliberate electrocution in the area in the last three years though officials put the figure at four.



In order to kill the large animals besides wild animals like boars and deer, poachers use sagging 11 KV lines between Jarapara and Tikarpada.



While elephants are killed for tusks, meat of other animals are sold in Angul and nearby villages. Wildlife activists alleged that despite rampant poaching through electrocution, neither the forest nor the electricity department officials have taken any action to set things right.



The sagging overhead live electric wires in the area are yet to be repaired. Wildlife activists alleged that there is no deterrence to stop the offenders.



Following the death of the elephant last week, Forest officials have arrested one Gobardhan Pradhan and are on the look out for four more accused.



An FIR has also been registered by the electricity department against some locals for taking illegal power connection.
