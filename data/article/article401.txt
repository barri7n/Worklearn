COIMBATORE: A 74-year-old man and an elephant were today found dead near a
solar powered electric fence erected around a banana farm at Lingapuram in
the district, police said.

The power to the fence was reportedly switched on using a switch operated
by a rope, only when elephants came near the farm.

As Ramaiah, the farm-owner, noticed the elephant, he pulled the rope, which
was wet due to rains for the last couple of days and it came into contact
with the 'live' fence and he was electrocuted, police said.

The elephant, which attempted to enter the farm, also was electrocuted.


Police along with senior officials of Tamil Nadu Electricity Board and
Forest department are investigating the matter.
