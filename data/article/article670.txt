AGRA: In a six-day rescue operation carried out by Wildlife SOS in
collaboration with UP forest department and police personnel, a 44-year-old
elephant was rescued from a group of wildlife traffickers.

The elephant had spent nearly four decades in illegal custody and was found
to be suffering from chronic medical problems like progressive blindness,
arthritis, degenerative joint disorder and foot issues — all pointing to
severe neglect, lack of medical care and improper diet, according Wildlife
SOS officials.

After several days of investigation, the chief wildlife warden, UP forest
department, shifted the pachyderm to Wildlife SOS Elephant Care and
Conservation Centre (ECCC) in Mathura where it will be under lifetime care
and treatment.

“The forest officers were keeping tabs on movement of this elephant, called
Priyanka, for nearly a year to gather evidence,” said a member of the
Wildlife SOS team.
