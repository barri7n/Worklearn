Banda Aceh. Another elephant has been found dead in Aceh, the second this month, with reports from local people indicating that the elephantâ€™s tusks have been removed.



â€œConflicts between elephants and humans often happen in Blang Tualang and the neighboring village of Pante Labu,â€ Rabono Wiranata, the head of non-governmental organization Fakta said on Friday. â€œSome villagers or hunters may have placed poison on the track often used by elephants.â€



The adult male elephant was found on Thursday inside an oil palm plantation run by state-owned PTPN I in Blang Tualang village, East Aceh.



Rabono said the elephant was understood to have died four days ago.



He added that local residents had repeatedly complained about a pack of elephants â€œtrespassingâ€ on their plantations and destroying plants, but there had been no serious response from the local authorities.



The head of Acehâ€™s Natural Resources Conservation Agency (BKSDA), Amon Zamora, said he received a report of the death on Thursday night. A team was dispatched to the area on Friday morning.



â€œBut [the team] havenâ€™t returned, so I donâ€™t know yet as to what caused the elephantâ€™s death,â€ Amon told the Jakarta Globe. â€œIâ€™ve told the team to report the case to police if the tusks were gone. If they were gone, we would strongly suspect that itâ€™s been murdered.â€



The finding came just two weeks after a 30-year-old male elephant was found dead in Ranto Sabon village in the Aceh Jaya district, Its tusks had been severed.



Aceh Jaya Forest Ranger commander Armidi said the elephant died after it was caught in a sharp metal trap placed on a big tree log.



Police and BKSDA Aceh have not been able to find the perpetrators.



The latest finding brought the number of elephant deaths in Aceh to four over the past three months.



On May 9, a 10-year-old male elephant was found dead due to electrocution in Bangkeh village in the Pidie district.



On June 23, a two-year-old elephant died after having been looked after for two months by residents of Blang Pante village in the North Aceh district. The villagers took care of the elephant cub after it was left behind by its pack in a local plantation.



Demand for ivory has soared in recent years, primarily due to increased demand from China, where it is highly valued for its use in crafting ornaments. Elephant tusks sell for several hundred dollars per kilogram.
