A 16-year-old female elephant died as it came in contact with a live wire
illegally connected to a fence put up around a private farm at Vettukadu
area in Goodalur forest range in Cumbum on Saturday.

The forest officials said the elephant touched the live wire crossing the
farm while entering into it for food and water. The farm belonged to one
Rajendran, who was said to be absconding. Forest officials said that
electric fencing was illegal.

After post mortem, forest officials buried the carcass.
