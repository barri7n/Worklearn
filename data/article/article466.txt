A female wild elephant was found shot dead on a private land in the fringes
of forests under the Chethalayam range of the south Wayanad forest division
on Tuesday.

The carcass of the 20- year-old elephant with three bullet wounds on its
head was found in a pepper plantation situated just 25 metres away from the
forest boundary.

South Wayanad divisional forest officer, Abdul Azeez said that the elephant
was shot using a country-made gun. "The animal could have been shot at
night. We were informed by local residents about the incident at around 12
noon," he said.

Forest officials said that there were crop raiding incidents by elephants
in the area recently and investigation is focusing on whether it was a
retaliatory killing by farmers.

Forest veterinary surgeon, V I Jijimon, who conducted the post mortem, said
that two bullets were lodged in the brain while one bullet was recovered
from the brain stem. He said that the elephant could have been shot in the
wee hours of Tuesday morning.

This is the second elephant shooting incident in Wayanad in the last two
months.
