An elephant belonging to the Nagarhole tiger reserve was paralysed after it suffered a bullet wound in its spine. The tusker, aged around 16 years, fell into a ditch in Aanechowkur range of the national park after suffering injuries.



The elephant was found by a team of forest officials while patrolling on Thursday afternoon. Later, the team returned to the spot with a camp elephant to try and pull out the tusker from the ditch.



Speaking to DNA, Nagarhole tiger reserve deputy conservator of forests Vijay Ranjan Singh said that the pachyderm was unable to move its pelvic region.



Since it was already night, the elephant was administered glucose in the ditch. The rescue operation resumed on Friday morning, but was of no use. While the camp elephant tried to pull up the fallen tusker, a bullet wound was noticed in its spine.



Ruling out poaching in the incident, he said that it was a case of the elephant being injured while it was trying to raid a private farm land. In poaching cases, elephants would be usually shot in the head and attempt would be made to remove the tusks.



But this elephant had been shot in the spine and its tusks were intact. Attempts are still on to bring the elephant out of the ditch and feed glucose to it. A search is on for the person who allegedly shot it.
