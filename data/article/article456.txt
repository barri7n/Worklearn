A rogue elephant, which was translocated from the city to Anamalai
Tiger Reserve (ATR) in the district, died tonight.

Overdose of tranquiliser was believed to be the reason for the death,
forest department sources said.

Maharaj which was creating menace for the last one year in Madukkarai
and nearby areas on the outskirts, killing three persons in the
process, was tranquilised and taken to Varakaliyar camp in Top Slip
coming in ATR two days ago.

As the elephant started resisting, another dose was shot, before taking to ATR.

Forest Department sources had earlier today claimed that the elephant,
put in a specially made wooden kraal, remained aggressive and there
was no signs of taming.

Despite opposition from environmentalists and animal enthusiasts
against turning it into Kumki (trained elephant), the department had
decided to provide training to it.
