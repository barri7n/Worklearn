Coimbatore: The carcass of an elephant was today found in Ayyasamymalai in
the forest range of Madukkarai on the outskirts.

The Anti-Poaching wing noticed the 18-year-old elephant lying dead and
informed the forest department, department officials said.

Officials suspect that the pachyderm could be the same one which strayed
into human habitats a couple of days ago and damaged the gate of a house
and some crops.

Autopsy will reveal the real cause of the death, they said
