A she-elephant in an advanced stage of pregnancy has been shot dead by poachers at the Hurulu Environment park in close proximity to Kodigalakande Forest Hermitage at Habarana-Trincomalee main road.

Wildlife officials attached to Mahaweli Zone said that this 20 to 25 years old and 6 1/2 foot tall elephant would have probably been shot somewhere near June 5 or 6, a day before Poson Poya day.

Veterinary surgeon Dr. Suhada Jayasekera said that the death was due to haemorrage from gun shot wounds caused by a glakatas gun used by the poacher.

This she-elephant had the half finished grass in its mouth at the time of the death and it would have probably given birth to a baby-elephant in another two or three days, if not met with this tragic encounter, Dr. Suhada Jayasekera said.
