BHUBANESWAR/ROURKELA: A female elephant died after a passenger train hit it
near Beheramunda in Sundargarh district late on Friday. The animal died on
the spot.

In another incident, an ailing elephant fell into mud in a paddy field near
Deulijhar village in Angul district on Saturday.

Sources said 19 elephants reportedly entered Sundargarh forest division on
Friday evening.

A team of forest officials chased the elephant to keep them away from
Lamlibahal, but the herd entered the village and damaged a couple of
houses.

Later the elephant herd got divided and nine of them moved towards the
railway track.

Eight of them crossed the track, whereas a six-year-old female elephant got
hit by the Yesvantpur-Tata Express “Keeping the elephant movement in mind,
we had requested the railway officials to control the speed of the train.”
