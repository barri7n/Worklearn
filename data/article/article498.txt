A female elephant and her calf got electrocuted on Tuesday as they came in
touch with a live electric wire allegedly laid by a local at a farm in
Chhattisgarh’s Surajpur district, forest officials said. “The incident took
place in the wee hours at a sugarcane field in Bagda village under
Pratappur forest range,” Division Forest Officer (Surajpur division) Naved
Shujauddin told PTI.

As per preliminary information, the adult pachyderm and her female calf
came in contact with the live wire laid around the sugarcane field
allegedly by the farm owner to protect his crop from the wild animals, he
said. Soon after being informed about the incident, forest and police
officials rushed to the spot and shifted the carcasses for postmortem, the
DFO said.

“Action will be taken against the farm owner after receiving the autopsy
report,” he said, adding that a case has been registered in this
connection. The thick forested northern Chhattisgarh, consisting of
Surguja, Korba, Surajpur, Raigarh, Jashpur and Korea districts, is known
for human-animal conflicts.

The region has witnessed several killings of tribals as well as elephants
and widespread damage to houses and crops by rogue pachyderms in the past
years. Sometimes, the locals illegally lay the electric wires around their
farms to prevent wild elephants from destroying their crops.
