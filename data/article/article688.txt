A four-day-old elephant calf was killed when it was caught in a stampede of
elephants while crossing a waterbody in the Rayakottai forest range in the
early hours of Tuesday.

According to forest department sources, a herd of elephants was moving
along with the elephant calf from Uddanapalli to Kilamangalam.

When the animals were crossing a lake which had little water, the calf
walking in the middle of the herd fell.

Without noticing this, the other elephants walked over the calf, due to
which it was killed on the spot.

On receiving information, Deepak S. Bilgi, District Forest Officer, and
Priyadarshini, Assistant Conservator of Forests, rushed to the spot.

Autopsy was conducted by a veterinary surgeon and the carcass was buried
later, forest sources said.
