GUWAHATI: Battling for life for about a month with two bullet wounds in his head, a wild tusker succumbed to his injuries in Sonitpur district on Sunday afternoon.

The carcass was spotted in a paddy field adjacent to the Behali Reserve Forest, about 180 km from Guwahati. A senior forest official said the elephant was about 20 years old and 6.5 ft tall.

The official added that some members of a tribal group, called Daphala, had last month tried to kill the elephant and feast on it. Though the elephant was hit by a bullet, the pachyderm managed to survive.

Members of an NGO, Natures Bonyacran, had first spotted the injured elephant on August 15, but they could not tranquilize the animal because they did not have a pachyderm with them to catch the wounded animal. "The animal eventually lost its way in the forest," coordinator of the NGO Ajoy Sarma said.

Natures Bonyacran members had been searching for the injured elephant since then and he was spotted again on Saturday. "He came out of the jungle on Sunday in search of food and went straight towards paddy fields," Sarma said.

After informing the doctor of Centre for Wildlife Rehabilitation Centre. the NGO workers had been keeping a close watch on the jumbo since the morning. Sarma said, "It died around 1.30pm and the doctor arrived after half an hour since then. We found two bullet injuries in the head of the elephant's carcass. One of the marks was fresh. Incidentally, we heard sounds of gunshots on Sunday morning," he added.
