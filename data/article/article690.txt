PRACHUAP KHIRI KHAN: Police are hunting down the gunmen who brutally killed
a wild elephant in a national park in Kui Buri district.

Provincial police chief Pol Maj Gen Pattana Petsayanawin on Monday set up
three teams of investigators to collect information and look for clues in
their manhunt for the killers of the 20-year-old beast. Soldiers are
joining the police in a combined effort to hunt down the perpetrators.

The male elephant was found dead in the Kui Buri National Park on Friday.

A preliminary autopsy by veterinarians from the National Park, Wildlife and
Plant Conservation Department found a rifle bullet and a shotgun bullet in
the body.

Police said they will examine firearm registrations in Kui Buri, Muang and
Samroi Yot districts as part of their investigation. Plantations in areas
adjacent to the national park have occasionally been raided by hungry wild
elephants.

Investigation chief Pol Col Chana Suwannakomol said angry farmers might be
to blame for the death. Srisawad Boonma, the kamnan of tambon Haad Kham
where the elephant's body was found, said local residents had learned how
to coexist with wild animals. The problem could come from outsiders who
entered the area, he suggested.

The park has filed a complaint with the Haad Kham police station on the
death of the elephant. Officials removed its tusks and took them to the Kui
Buri park office.

Monks from Wat Rai Bon held a religious ceremony on Sunday before the
animal was cremated in the forest. "I pray that people and authorities will
help conserve elephants in Kui Buri. It was sad to see an elephant, our
national symbol, killed," abbot Phra Khru Dhammavipak said.
