An elephant was electrocuted at Kanha National Park in Madhya Pradesh 
Tuesday, forest officials said.

The adult elephant, named Shivaji, had been trained by the forest department 
and died after coming into contact with overhead electrical wires, officials 
said.

"The body of the elephant has been sent for a post mortem examination and we 
have ruled out foul play," said a senior official.

According to the forest department, the elephant was released in the woods 
and accidentally came in contact with a live wire.

Last week, a tiger was mauled to death by another tiger at Bandhavgarh 
National Park in Madhya Pradesh. A fortnight ago, a tiger was run over by a 
train at the same park.
