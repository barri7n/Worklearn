Bargarh, Dec 7 (ANI): Forest officials and villagers in Bargarh District of Orissa have rescued a five-month-old male elephant calf from a forest area after it had wandered off from its herd on Tuesday.

The Forest officials quickly swung into action after villagers informed them about the calf which they found abandoned in the Bhatli forest range and brought him to a nursery.

"We rescued the male elephant calf from near the Bhatli village of Bargarh district. Then we took him to a nursery," said Anadi Charan Dash, a forest ranger.

fficials pointed out that the calf might belong to a pair of elephants that were found dead on November 18 in the same forest.

Two elephants, one male and one female were found dead. It was suspected that they were killed by the hunters.

Villagers are flocking to the nursery to get a glimpse of the baby elephant.

Experts have repeatedly opined that massive deforestation, poaching and encroachment in forest corridors have forced elephants to move out of their natural habitats in search of food and water.

India has over 50 percent of the world's Asiatic elephant population. But their number has dwindled in recent years.
