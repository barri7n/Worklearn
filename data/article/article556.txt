
DEHRADUN: An elephant died in Rajaji on Friday night after falling
unconscious during the day, taking the number of elephant deaths in the
past eight months in the forest to 10. The deaths, however, were caused not
from poaching, but other reasons such as railway accidents, electrocution
and infighting.

Officials are considering extreme heat to be responsible for the death,
though they pointed out that a number of water holes were created to
provide water to wild animals. Although the post-mortem had been conducted
in the afternoon, the report was yet to come out.

According to wildlife warden Komal Singh, after the elephant went
unconscious in the Friday morning, his treatment was started, but by the
night his condition began deteriorating and he died.

"Primarily, it seems that the jumbo died due to extreme weather conditions.
However, the post-mortem report is yet to come," he said.

Rajaji director Sanatan Sonkar even pointed to a number of artificial water
holes filled with fresh water in the park area to quench wild animals'
thrust. Even a few trenches have been dug up for elephants to take mud bath
to cool off.

"All the 10 elephants died either their natural deaths or of some other
reasons such as railway accident, electrocution and infighting, but not due
to poaching," said Sonkar.
