JAMBI, Indonesia â€“  Two endangered Sumatran elephants were found dead in
western Indonesia and authorities believe they were killed by poachers.

Krismanko Padang, head of nongovernment group of Indonesia Elephant
Conservation Forum, said carcasses of the two male elephants were
discovered early this week near a palm oil plantation in the Tebo district
of Jambi province on Sumatra island.

Their skulls were found without tusks, Krismanko said late Wednesday. He
added that police who are investigating discovered some bullet shells near
the scene. He urged the police to thoroughly investigate to find the
perpetrators or their masterminds.

He quoted villagers as saying a group of about 30 elephants had been
wandering around the region in recent weeks.

In September, three elephants were found poisoned in Aceh in northern
Sumatra.

Fewer than 3,000 Sumatran elephants are left in the wild. Environmentalists
say they could be extinct within three decades unless they are protected.
