JAKARTA (AP): Six wild elephants were poisoned to death in Sumatra after the 
endangered animals encroached on a palm oil plantation, police said on 
Monday.

The killing of elephants as well as endangered tigers are common place on 
the island, where illegal logging and farming have shrunk their natural 
reserves and increased clashes with humans.

The elephants were found dead near the Rokan Hulu forest in Riau province 
about 1,050 kilometers (652 miles) northwest of the capital Jakarta. 
Plantation workers admitted to sickening them with rat poison.

"The wild elephants have become a big problem for us and we had no other 
choice than to poison them so we could secure the plantation," said Lindung 
Nasution, one of the workers.

Police are investigating the deaths. No arrests have been made. (**)
