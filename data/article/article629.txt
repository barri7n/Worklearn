A sub-adult elephant was found dead at Tarabari area  near Naxalbari of
Darjeeling district with forest officials suspecting the jumbo was probably
electrocuted while seeking food in the wee hours today.

DFO, Kurseong, Sandip Berwal said the female pachyderm was sub-adult and
perhaps waylaid from the herd in search of food. He said a post-mortem will
be done on the corpse to determine the causes of death.

With the latest death, at least six jumbos were killed in the Kurseong
forest range so far this season.
