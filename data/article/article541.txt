Yet another orphaned elephant has arrived at Wingabaw Elephant Camp,
located in Bago Region.

The recently orphaned 5 months old baby elephant, nicknamed “Pan Nu May”
which loosely translates into “flower girl”, is the fourth orphan the
elephant preservation camp had taken in.

Pan Nu May’s mother had passed away from old age but the other three baby
elephants weren’t so lucky with their parents having been hunted down by
poachers.

“The latest baby elephant amongst us is Pan Nu May, and she’s from Dawei.
It has been around two weeks since her mother died. There is one called
Mary, named so because she came to us on Christmas Day, and she was found
amongst a pack of cattle in Ayeyawady Region. Poachers got to her mother
and skinned the poor creature. Another elephant called Ayeyarmay was given
to us by a farmer couple who had taken care of her since she was found
alone and lost in the forest. The last one, Yu Yu Htay, was sent to us from
Nay Pyi Taw when the mother died from stomach flu. We have to rely on milk
powder because all four are still at a milking age,” said a Wingabaw
Elephant Camp staff member.

Wingabaw opened in November 2016 and now attracts around 400 visitors per
week.

Locals pay Ks 5,000 for entry, while foreigners pay Ks 20,000.
