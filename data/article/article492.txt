A tusker was electrocuted when it tried to enter a farmland at
Kanchenahalli in Sathanur hobli, Kanakapura, 60 km south of Bengaluru, on
Thursday night.

Nagesh had erected an electric fence across his farmland to prevent wild
animals destroying the crops. On Thursday night, a 50-year-old elephant
strayed into Kanchenahalli. When it tried to enter the farmland, its tusk
brushed the fence and the animal was electrocuted, police said.

The incident came to light on Friday morning when villagers spotted the
dead elephant. They called the jurisdictional Sathanur police. Forest
officials arrived at the spot and conducted the post-mortem.

Based on a complaint filed by forest officials, police have booked Nagesh
for illegally erecting an electric fence. They are trying to trace him as
he has absconded.

On December 7, a tusker died from bullet injuries near the Kodihalli forest
range. Forest officials are chasing stray tuskers back to the forest.
