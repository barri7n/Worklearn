Jakarta. A wild Sumatran elephant was found dead in a village in Riau,
allegedly hunted and killed for its tusks, according to Antara.

?The elephant was found in a horrible condition, the head was almost
split, and there?s a hole allegedly caused by a gunshot,? Tomy
Simanungkalit, director of of a civil society organization Riau Madani,
was quoted as saying by state-run Antara news agency on Thursday.

Tomy said the elephant was found dead in Lubuk Kembang Bunga village in
Pelalawan district last week. The elephant was part of  a herd from Tesso
Nilo National Park (TNTN).

Riau Natural Resources Conservation Agency (BKSDA) Riau and Pelalawan Baru
Police performed the autopsy on the adult male elephant on Tuesday.

?There?s a strong indication that the perpetrator used an electric
chainsaw to cut off its trunk and its face to get the ivory,? Tomy said.

This case adds to the long list of elephant deaths in Riau due to hunting
and conflict with humans. Forty-five elephants have died in Sumatra since
2012.
