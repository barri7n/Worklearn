JALPAIGURI: Villagers at Milanpalli on the outskirts of Baikunthapur
forest, some 30km from Jalpapiguri, found a tusker lying dead in a paddy
field. The manner in which the pachyderm died has left foresters baffled.

"We are not sure what exactly led to the tusker's death. It can be a
natural death too. We are not ruling out the possibility of electrocution
or poisoning either. Only after post mortem, the reason can be known," said
Sanjay Dutta, ranger of Belakoba forest.

This is the second tusker death in the last 10 days. On September 8, an
adult tusker was electrocuted at the Mendabari beat in Chilapata forest
under the Jaldapara National Park.

Incidentally, Friday was Biswakarma Puja and in Dooars elephant is
worshipped as 'Mahakal' on this day. To protest such deaths, the Samaj O
Nadi Bachao Committee, Jalpaiguri, arranged for a hathi (elephant) puja at
the Thana More in the town. Their intention was to create awareness about
elephants among common people.

"As many as six elephants have died over the past one year in Dooars in
places like Baikunthapur, Moraghat, Mongpong, Sevoke and Buxa. We want to
create and awareness and would like to ask the forest department to teach
the vehicle drivers the rules while driving on roads through the forests so
that wild animals can live safely in their habitat," said Sanjib
Chatterjee, convener of the committee.

In the pilkhanas (the place where kunki elephants stay) of Gorumara and
Jaldapara national parks elephants were also offered pujas on Friday.
