Elephants have killed five people in two separate attacks in eastern India,
an official said Monday. One of the animals died after being tranquilized.

Senior forest official Ajay Das said one man was killed Monday after he
walked out of his home in a village in Burdwan district of West Bengal
state. The man encountered five elephants, and was tossed in the air and
trampled by one of them.

In a separate incident Sunday in another part of the district, four people
were killed when three elephants attacked them.

Das said one elephant in that group, a male, was tranquilized and later
died. An adult female and a calf ran away. The three elephants left a trail
of destruction, he said.

As rapid urbanization cuts into India's forests, animals and humans have
come into increasing conflict.
