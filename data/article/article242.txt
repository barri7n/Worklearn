Berhampur: A tusker was allegedly killed by poachers for its tusks in Ganjam district. Forest officials recovered the carcass of a 60-year-old tusker from the dense jungle of Karchuli, near Madhapalli village under Buguda forest range, on Tuesday.

The elephant was electrocuted after the animal got entangled in live electric wires, laid down by suspected poachers in the area, forest officials said. The poachers decamped with a portion of one of the tusks, while another tusk was found intact, they said.

""We suspect the poachers laid the live electric wires in the area for poaching wild bore. However, the elephant came in contact with the live wire and was killed,"" said divisional forest officer (DFO), Ghumusara (south), R Ch Sethi. Forest officials recovered the wires along with the tusks of the animal. The carcass was sent for a postmortem. No one has been arrested in this connection yet, the DFO said.

The incident occurred just a day after the forest department announced reward for tip-offs about plans of poaching through electrocution in the district. At least three elephants died of electrocution recently in Ghumusara, north division in the district, while at least eight mammals, including wild bore, barking deer and sambar have been killed in the region in the span of a year when they came in contact with live wires laid down by poachers, sources said.
