Two elephants that had destroyed cultivated lands in Kuttigala,

Office.

The two wild elephants have been roaming in the surrounding villages for a
month disrupting the day-to-day work of the villagers. The elephants will
be taken to Udawalawe Reserve.

Meanwhile, an injured wild elephant is reportedly roaming in Athimale,
Moneragala for the last one week. The wildlife officials have not yet
attended to the animal.
