A female wild elephant aged three years was found dead in a well at
Kaithapara in the Thodupuzha range of the Kothamangalam forest division on
Sunday.

The well had no protective wall.

A nearby house was found damaged by the wild elephants.

The residents of the house were away in Ernakulam for medical treatment. It
is suspected that two elephants intruded into the area and the female
elephant accidentally fell into the well.

A post-mortem examination would be conducted on Monday, said Kothamangalam
Divisional Forest Officer Unnikrishnan who reached the spot.
