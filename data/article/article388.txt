BARIPADA:Carcass of a female elephant was found in Subarnamanjari under
Dukura range inside Similipal Biosphere Reserve in Mayurbhanj district on
Tuesday.

The elephant was part of a herd of 16 elephants and had fallen into a gorge
on Monday. The herd, including tuskers, was spotted moving in and around
Subarnamanjari for more than a week.

Forest officials, led by Assistant Conservator of Forest (ACF) Arun Kumar
Patra and Dukura ranger Batakrushna Padhee, reached the spot with a team of
veterinary surgeons after the herd had moved from the spot following the
elephant’s death.

 DFO Sanjay Kumar Swain said the elephant was about seven years old and
died after falling into a gorge.

The jumbo suffered severe head injuries leading to its death.  Two small
‘tushs’ were found intact and were recovered during postmortem, he said.

 Deputy Director of Similipal Biosphere Reserve Ajit Kumar Satpathy denied
the allegation of poaching because it was a female jumbo. “The cause of its
death can be ascertained once we get the autopsy report,” he said and urged
the locals not to term all elephant deaths as poaching without proof.
