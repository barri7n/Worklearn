A leopard was trapped at Varakodu near Nanjangud while an elephant was
found electrocuted near Periyapatna on Tuesday evening.

The leopard was around two years old and had come close to an
industrial area when it was spotted by locals. They contacted the
Forest Department, who placed a cage with live bait 10 days ago. The
leopard fell into the trap on Tuesday and was released into Moolehole
range of BNP on Wednesday.

Meanwhile, the elephant was electrocuted in Chokhi village in
Periyapatna. It is said to be a 50-year-old male. It came in contact
with a live power line illegally drawn from an HV cable to keep
animals at bay. Assistant Conservator of Forests Prasanna Kumar said
the village is hardly 300 metres from Anechokur forest. A case has
been registered against the farm owner, Gangadhar, and his son Lokesh.

Incidentally, five elephants have died in the Mysuru-Kodagu region in
the last few days. Three elephants were found dead in different parts
of the region two weeks ago, while another was found electrocuted in a
coffee estate in Somwarpet taluk three days ago.
