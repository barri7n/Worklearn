The scourge of man-elephant conflict has manifested again with a wild
elephant being electrocuted at Haadanuru village in the Hediyala range of
Bandipur National Park on Friday.

The tusker, which strayed from its habitat, approached an agricultural
field and came in contact with an illegal electrical fence and died
instantly. The honorary wildlife warden of Chamarajanagar Naveen Kumar, who
was at the place, confirmed the incident to The Hindu and said prima facie
the death was due to electrocution but would be confirmed by laboratory
reports. This is the 5th elephant to have died of electrocution around
Bandipur so far this year, said Mr. Kumar.

The agricultural field belonged to a farmer by name Rachaiah. The
veterinarian Nagaraj, who conducted the post-mortem, said there were fences
in the vicinity of the field and traces of injuries on the elephant.
