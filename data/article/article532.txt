A 40-year-old tusker died after consuming contaminated water in
Biligirirangantha Temple Wildlife Sanctuary.

The elephant had come to quench its thirst from Balebare tank in BRT and
consumed contaminated water. The jumbo fell ill and died in the tank on
Monday. Forest personnel on patrolling found the elephant dead in the tank.
A crane was brought to lift it.

ACF Nagraj said the elephant died of lung infection after consuming slushy
water as waterholes have dried up in the forest.   A spotted deer was also
found dead at the check post.
