A 15-year-old male elephant and a two-year-old spotted deer were
electrocuted in a farm near Kallar in the Mettupalayam Forest Range after
they came into contact with a live wire on Tuesday night.

The wire was cut off after a tree fell on it due to heavy wind and rain,
said Mettupalayam forest range officer M Nazir.

"Since it rained, the soil was wet, and there could have been small pools
of water. The tusker and the deer stepped on the live wire and died," Nazir
told TOI.

On Wednesday morning, the owner of the farm, M N Gopalswamy, spotted the
carcass of the elephant and the deer. "He reported the incident to us, and
we reached the spot around 9am. Veterinary doctors conducted the postmortem
and confirmed the reason for the death," Nazir said.

The accident happened in an elephant corridor. "The elephant and the deer
could have come for fodder," Nazir said.

Environmentalist K Mohanraj said such incidents were uncommon but could be
prevented. "The state government can insulate the electric cables. However,
the incident needs to be thoroughly investigated, and we need to see if
there has been a sabotage," he said.
