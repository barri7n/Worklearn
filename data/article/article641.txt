Chompoo, the wounded elephant who was swept into a canal in rural Thailand
and had us all on the edge of our seats during the two-day rescue effort
last week, died at the world-famous elephant hospital on Saturday night,
following the dramatic rescue.

The Thai Elephant Conservation Center, in Lampang province, held a buddhist
funeral for Chompoo yesterday morning, amid the sadness of the
veterinarians and staff members who had been caring for the pachyderm.

The wild male elephant, estimated to be 15-20 years old, was found stuck in
Phitsanulok’s Chompoo canal on Oct. 17. Since his hind legs did not work,
it took over 24 hours for officials to safely help him onto the shore.

Hopes were raised after a team of veterinarians were able to transport him
to the elephant hospital on Friday and named him “Chompoo” after the canal
he was found in. But after a good fight, Chompoo died on Saturday morning.

It was assumed that Chompoo died of kidney failure, likely brought on by
extreme stress, according to the Nikorn Thongthip, from the veterinary
science faculty of Chiang Mai University, Bangkok Post reported.

“The veterinarian team has done their best to save this wild elephant,” he
said in a media briefing.

An autopsy to determine his cause of death will be conducted at by the
National Elephant Institute, and Kasetsart and Chiang Mai Universities. The
results are expected in two weeks.

Chompoo will be a case study for the future treatment and rehabilitation of
wild elephants.
