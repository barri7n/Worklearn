RUDRAPUR: A 13-year-old male elephant was found dead in the jungles of
Tanda range under central forest division in Udham Singh Nagar district on
Saturday. Forest officials said that the pachyderm is believed to have been
electrocuted by an electric wire in Pantnagar’s Sainik farms.

According to forest officials, a farmer had installed electric fencing
around his farm to keep off wild elephants. The male elephant came in
contact with that fence, following which it died. The farmer has been
arrested and will be produced before court.

“Forest department staff have already requested farmers not to connect live
wire to their fence, but some farmers are not paying heed. We registered a
case under Wildlife Protection Act against farmer Harbhajan Singh, a 
resident of Jainagar 5 and detained him,” forests conservator PF Dhakate
said, adding that the carcass seems to be two days old as it had started
rotting.

Forest department veterinary doctor conducted post-mortem. Later, the
carcass of the elephant was buried in the agricultural land. Experts said
that wild elephants have been moving out of the jungles with people
encroaching upon animal corridors, leading to clashes between elephants and
villagers.
