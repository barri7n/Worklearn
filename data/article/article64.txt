COOCH BEHAR, Jan. 11: Bangladesh Rifles jawans gunned down an Indian elephant which had stormed into Bangladesh early this morning and had killed one person, injured another and destroyed about 25 hutments at Burimari in Lalmonirhat district, Bangladesh.
According to the Cooch Behar district magistrate, Mr Rajesh Sinha, the decision to shoot down the elephant was taken after all efforts to control it and bring it back to India failed.
The wild elephant apparently had wandered out of forest in Jalpaiguri. Apprehending that the BDR jawans could kill the tusker, the Cooch Behar DM had contacted his counterpart in Lalmonirhat, Md Rafiqul Islam, over phone and had requested the latter to save the animal.
Senior forest officials, including the chief conservator of forests, Mr S Patel, Cooch Behar DFO, Mr Apurba Sen, and Jalpaiguri DFO, Mr Tapas Das, also went to the border near Mekhliganj along with two tame elephants from Jaldapara, a crane and a truck. Trained forest personnel of the elephant squad from Gorumara armed with guns and tranquilliser bullets too went to the border. But all arrangements went in vain in the end.
“The elephant broke open the gates of the barbed wire fencing along the border under Doradabri border outpost adjacent to pillar number 849 in the early hours and crossed over to Burimari,” the Cooch Behar DM, said.
