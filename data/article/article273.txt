RAMGARH: A young elephant of 30 years was found dead at Betulkala village under Gola block of Ramgarh district, 35 km from the district headquarters on Thursday.



Senior police officers rushed to the spot and are conducting an inquiry into the death.



A K Singh, divisional forest officer (DFO) of Ramgarh, confirmed the death. He said, "A young tusker was found dead in Gola forests. The cause of death is yet to be ascertained." A team of veterinary doctors conducted a postmortem of the dead elephant.



"We are awaiting the postmortem results but initial reports suggest there is no external injury on the body," he added. If it turns out to be a case of killing by villagers who face regular attacks by herds of elephants, the forest department will take necessary legal action against them, warned the officer.



Finding the tusker dead, local villagers of Betulkala village informed the forest officers. A crowd assembled at the spot and started offering prayers to the body as they believe that elephants are an incarnation of Lord Ganesha. Some villagers felt this could be an ill-omen.



Meanwhile, forest officers did not rule out the possibility of the tusker being given toxic pesticide. This is not the first time when an elephant was killed in the area.



In all three tuskers were electrocuted near Harubera railway station in Barkakana-Muri rail route of South Eastern Railway (SER) some years ago as this rail route passes through an elephant habitat.
