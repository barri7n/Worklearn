ERODE: A 20-year-old tusker was found dead in Sathyamangalam Tiger Reserve
(STR) here on Friday with tusks missing from the carcass. Forest officials
have picked up a few people for questioning.

According to G Arunlal, district forest officer, STR, the carcass was
spotted at Mookanpalayam village, which is situated on Tamil Nadu-Karnataka
interstate border, by local people on Friday morning.

He said the villagers might have removed the tusks before passing on the
information to the forest department.

Veterinarians, who performed postmortem, said the elephant had died of
stomach ailments caused due to ulcer. “The animal seemed to have been sick
for a few weeks and it could have died as it couldn’t take any food,” the
district forest officer said.

After the postmortem, the carcass was buried in the forest. The district
forest department has lodged a complaint with the Sathyamangalam police to
trace the tusks.

Police subsequently pressed a sniffer dog into service to trace the
accused. Preliminary investigation suggested that people living in
Karnataka villages adjoining to STR might have been involved in the case.

Forest officials have picked up a few people from both TN and Karnataka
villages for inquiry. The Sathyamangalam police and the forest officials
have registered separate cases and further inquiries are on.
