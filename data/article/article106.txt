CHAMARAJNAGAR: A 25-year-old female elephant was found dead at a farm owned by Rangya Nayaka of Kotkere village under Omkar forest range in Gundlupet taluk.

Sources said that the animal had died in 'mysterious circumstances'.

A post-mortem was conducted.

Meanwhile, villagers in the area staged a protest against the increased movement of wildlife and subsequent crop loss in villages near the forest.

They alleged that forest officials— who refuse to assess reports of crop loss— turn up only to look into the death of wild animals; and harass innocent villagers by accusing them of killing animals.

The protestors further alleged that the department had not compensated the farmers who had lost their crop due to the growing menace created by the elephants.

The villagers called off their stir after intervention of Circle Inspector Deepak, Bandipur District Forest Officer Hanumanthappa , Forest Officer B K Singh and others.
