KEONJHAR, Aug 19: Poachers have become effective with the cancellation of the Baitarani Elephant Reserve Project. A tusker was killed in Banamahuladiha forest in Patna and the tusks were taken. The forest department came to know about the incident on 17 August while the carcass indicated that the crime was committed a week ago. While the forest department could not investigate the matter due to incessant rain the villagers said that there is sufficient proof to establish that it is a handiwork of the poachers. Mr Binaya Bhushan Patnaik, an elephant lover, said that the withdrawal of the Baitarani Elephant Reserve Project has endangered the lives of the pachyderm.
Mines are destroying acres of forest by going beyond their actual area. As pachyderm are herbivores, they are not getting sufficient food. The elephant corridors have been blocked. This is the reason as to why they are entering human habitations. And in turn, the poachers are taking advantages of it. Without the Elephant Reserve Project, the Keonjhar district will become devoid of elephants.
Hundreds of people have fallen prey to elephant attacks in the past 10 years, out of which 74 have died since 2001-02. On the other hand 47 elephants have died since 2001-02. According to the 1995 census, there were 59 elephants in Keonjhar, and 145 in the proposed project area. It can be noted here that the Baitarani Elephant Reserve Project was to come up in an area of 10,560 sq km.
