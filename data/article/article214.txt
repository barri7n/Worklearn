Erode (TN), Dec 15 (PTI) A 40-year-old female elephant was electrocuted when it came into contact with high voltage wire fencing around a tapioca field at Chinnathalatti area within Kadambur forest range here, police said. Perumal, a farmer, had erected the fencing to keep off elephants after some fields in the area had experienced heavy damage due to elephants entering them, police said. The carcass of the elephant was found near Perumal's field yesterday and a veterinarian who examined the elephant informed that the animal had died of electrocution, police said. Perumal is absconding but police said they have registered a case against his relative, Vijayakumar, in connection with the incident.
