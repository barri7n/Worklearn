DHENKANAL: A 45-year-old female elephant died after suffering a sunstroke near Dahimala reserve forest under Kapilas forest range in Dhenkanal on Wednesday afternoon. The corpse was sent for post mortem.

According to forest officials, the elephant was found lying on ground near a pond in Dahimala village around 11.30 am. Kapilas range forest officials along with local veterinary surgeons rushed to the spot and poured buckets of water on her. Hundreds of people flocked there and started pouring water for about three hours.

Though the elephant repeatedly tried to stand on its feet, it could not. Later, divisional forest officer Sunil Ku Dalai along with a fire brigade vehicle from Dhenkanal rushed to the spot.

Dalai said doctors had administered three drips and steroid injections. But she did not survive. An hour before its death, forest officials had informed PCCF to provide more medical support to cure the sick elephant, said Dalai.

Locals complained that fire brigade personnel were late in reaching the spot. Officials, in the department, however, denied the charge. "We tried our best to reach to spot and sprinkle water," said Ishaq Mohd, district fire officer. Kapilas forest ranger Suvendu Bhuyan said the elephant was suffering from dehydration as temperature was high in the region for the last five days.

Forest officials admitted that elephants had to travel long distances looking for water as water sources have dried up in the summer.

No habitat development is going on as there is acute funds constraints.
