Five rare Sumatran elephants found dead in Indonesia were likely to have been poisoned for damaging crops, according to an official.



There are up to 3,350 Sumatran elephants remaining in the wild, according to the World Wildlife Fund environmental group 



The elephants, aged two to four years old, were found dead in an oil-palm plantation in a village in Riau province on Sumatra island on Friday, according to a conservation agency official.



"Preliminary medical checks indicated that the elephants could have died from sulphur poisoning. We're still investigating," he said.



"We suspect villagers killed them using poison for wild boars as the elephants had damaged their crops. We're chasing the perpetrators."
