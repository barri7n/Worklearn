TANGI: While several incidents of anti-wildlife activities are being
reported from across the State, an ailing elephant was found struggling for
life in a crop field at Haladibasanta village under Dalijoda forest range
here in Cuttack district.

The locals spotted the tusker lying in the field and informed the forest
department for treatment.

The elephant was found feeling complication to move its head and body.

According to reports, a herd of elephants were found moving at the village
a week ago. While six elephants had returned to the forest, one elephant,
which was supposed to be ill, could not be to make its way back.

Last night, the elephant herd had again visited the village to take the
sick animal with them. However, they went back to the forest leaving the
elephant alone in the crop field.

The forest officials and veterinary doctors were yet to reach the spot till
the last report came in.
