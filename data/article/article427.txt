An elephant was shot at and its tail chopped off by unidentified persons in
Assam's Lakhimpur district, a forest official said here on Sunday.

The elephant received eight bullet injuries and was struggling for his life
in Kashjuli under Harmuti forest Range near Ranga Reserve Forest bordering
Arunachal Pradesh.

Divisional forest officer (DFO) Krishna Patgiri alleged the elephant was
shot at and injured by suspected poachers from Arunachal side of the
reserve forest.

The forest department received information on Saturday evening and took
initiative to provide treatment to the elephant.

A three-member team from the Assam State Zoo was scheduled to reach the
spot on Sunday and tranquilize the elephant.

A hunt has also been launched to nab the poachers, forest officials said.
