An elephant was electrocuted when it ventured into a paddy field in West
Bengal, forest officials said on Saturday.

The four-year-old male pachyderm was found dead in the field at Odlabari
gram panchayat area in Malda district.

Wildlife officers rushed to the spot after witnesses reported the incident.

Officials said prima facie it appeared that the animal died of electric
shock and a post-mortem would be performed to confirm this.

According to officials, it appeared that a herd 20-22 elephants entered the
area on Friday night from Bhuttabari forests and returned to the forests
except one male elephant.

It apparently stepped into the electric wire fencing put up by the
villagers to prevent wild animals from damaging crops.
