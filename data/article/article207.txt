KEONJHAR: Forest department employees on Saturday found the body of two adult elephants, one male and one female, from a remote forest in Ghungi village in Banspal block, about 30-km from here. Another elephant was run over by a train in Dhenkanal district.

The 20-year-old male elephant was about 10-foot-tall and the 25-year-old female one close to 9 feet. Officials suspected the death of the elephants was caused by electrocution, as there were burn injuries on the bodies of both. There was no confirmed report, however.

On Saturday morning, some tribals from a remote village, Ghungi, spotted the bodies and informed the forest department. The DFO and the ACF of Keonjhar division went to the spot along with forest officials.
