A rogue elephant that killed four persons in the last three days in Purnia
district of Bihar was shot dead by Hyderabad sharp-shooter Nawab Shafath
Ali Khan and his team of forest officials on Saturday morning.

The 35-year-old tusker strayed into Bihar from Nepal four days ago and
created havoc in some villages of the district.

On Wednesday, a teenager was killed by the elephant, while three others
were trampled to death in the following two days.

On Saturday, the tusker killed another person and damaged a house.

“We tried to tranquilise it and translocate it. But it continued to destroy
property and kill people.

It was moving towards human habitations and posing a risk. Finally, on
instructions of the forest officials who were accompanying me, I shot it
with a .458 Winchister Magnum bullet and it collapsed. It was inevitable,”
Mr. Shafath Ali told The Hindu over phone from Bihar.

A team of trained mahouts from West Bengal were also assisting their Bihar
counterparts and forest officials for last two days to translocate it. A
few thousand villagers had also gathered in the village outskirts to
prevent the tusker from moving into the villages but to no avail, he
explained.

P.K. Gupta, Regional Chief Conservator of Forest and District Forest
Officer S.S. Singh, IFS supervised the operation for the last four days.

A team of veterinary doctors conducted post-mortem examination of the
elephant and found that it was wounded in the trunk and perhaps became
aggressive due to it.
