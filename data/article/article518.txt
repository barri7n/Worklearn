A 25-year old female elephant, recued after it was stuck in slush, died
today in the Mudmalai Tiger Reserve camp in neighbouring Nilgiris District,
taking the number of elephant deaths in the MTR to five in the last one
week.

The elephant was roaming in search of water when it got trapped in the
slush in Karugudi forest range on February 23.

On being alerted by locals, forest department personnel rescued the
elephant which had suffered some injuries and took it to the camp for
treatment.

However, the elephant died this afternoon without responding to treatment,
forest department sources said.

This was the fifth elephant to die in the MTR area in the last one week.
Earlier, three elephants were found dead due to suspected starvation, while
another for want of water, they said.
