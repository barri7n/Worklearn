KRISHNAGIRI: A 15-year-old tusker was electrocuted when it tried to enter
an agricultural field in Thattasandram village near Denkanikottai in the
Krishnagiri district of Tamil Nadu on Monday morning.

The village is situated near the Aiyyur reserve forest.

The owner of the land, identified as K Muniraj, had installed an electric
fence to prevent elephants and other wild animals from damaging the crops.

"He had not obtained permission from the concerned officials before putting
up the electric fence. We arrested him for killing the tusker," a forest
official said.

"Muniraj confessed to his crime. He was remanded in judicial custody," said
district forest officer A K Ulaganathan.

Forest officials conducted a postmortem on the carcass of the tusker and
buried it in the reserve forest.
