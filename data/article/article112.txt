Bangalore: Autopsy has revealed that the 30-year-old elephant found dead near Bannerghatta National Park (BNP) on Sunday, was, in fact, shot dead, sending shock waves among conservationists and forest officials.
Speaking to DNA, principal chief conservator of forests BK Singh said that one bullet was recovered from the female pachyderm's brain and another from the back. Alibis suggest that the first bullet might have hit her back, and the second bullet the forehead, killing her on the spot, he said.
The cow-elephant was shot with a muzzle loader gun. The forensic and post-mortem reports will be ready in five days.
Forest officials said that a herd of seven elephants was camping on a private land abutting the park, and was found trampling ragi crops of farmers of Attiguppe village. An eye-witness said that he saw a man with a gun entering the area where the elephants had been camping.
Officials are interrogating the eye-witness and other villagers of Attiguppe and Goddur. Investigation is on to ascertain the identity of the killer. It is possible that an agitated farmer might have resorted to the act as the body was not mutilated, and there were minor injuries on the legs and back of the pachyderm.
As per the law, a buffer zone of at least 50 metres should be maintained between forest and private land, which is absent on most of BNP borders. Also, the department's several efforts to train farmers around the park in preventing elephants from entering their fields have hardly been implemented.
