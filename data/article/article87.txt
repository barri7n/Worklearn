RANCHI: Two elephants were found dead in Jharkhand, forest department officials said Saturday. One wild elephant had its tusks removed, leading to the suspicion that it had been killed by poachers. 

The wild elephant was found dead in Saranda jungle Friday with what looked like bullet wounds, an official said. Saranda is around 220 km from the state capital. Also, an elephant calf was found dead near Panjan Pahari of Dumka district, around 450 km from here. One of its partially developed tusks was missing too. 

"The elephants' dead bodies were found Friday. We have sent a team of forest officials at the spot. We will be able to tell the exact reason of death after the postmortem report," A.K. Gupta, regional chief conservator, Singhbhum, said.
