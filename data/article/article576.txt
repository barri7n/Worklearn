The carcass of a two-year-old elephant has been found on a Malaysian
highway after the baby animal was apparently killed by a vehicle, according
to wildlife conservation group Management & Ecology of Malaysian Elephants
(MEME).

Environmentalists said that a decrease in forest have forced wild elephants
closer to the East-West Highway, which links north-east Kelantan state to
the rest of Malaysia.
