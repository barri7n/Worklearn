Siliguri, Oct 18 (IANS) Two elephants, including a female, were
electrocuted in West Bengal's Darjeeling district Saturday, an official
said.
The tuskers were found in a paddy field in Rakamjot in Siliguri.
"Medical reports confirm they were electrocuted," Kurseong Divisional
Forest Officer Sailesh Anand said.
The deaths come a day after the carcass of a four-year-old rhino with its
horn missing was found in Gorumara National Park in Jalpaiguri district.
Meanwhile, forest and wildlife officials are having a tough time preventing
a herd of about 60 elephants from crossing over to Nepal. The herd is
currently camping in Bamanpokhri range of Kurseong forest division.
"We are trying to prevent the herd from straying into Nepal. There have
been instances earlier when elephants have been shot dead while entering
into Nepal," said Anand.
Forest officials, including members of elephant squad, are keeping a round
the clock vigil on the herd and are trying all means to prevent them from
straying into Nepal.
