PANAJI: Though all is quiet on Goa's border in the vicinity of Dodamarg, the peace has followed the tragic death of a female elephant after consuming some explosive-laden' trap recently. 

The elephant, a five year old female calf, was captured by Maharashtra forest officials on the other side of the border in a badly injured condition. "It was unable to eat anything and was administered 400 salines and daily injections. It somehow survived three weeks and died late last month," Naresh Zarmuri, district forest officer, Maharashtra said. 

The post-mortem examination revealed severe injuries, including broken jaws with three cracks on the upper one and six cavities. "When we caught the elephant, it had no teeth left," Zarmuri added. "It is possible that it had eaten some fruit or eatable with an explosive concealed in it, meant for wild boar" he said. 

The Maharashtra forest officials had trapped three elephants during the last few weeks with the help of a consultant from Assam and kunki elephants. One was released at Kendrem near Karnataka-Maharashtra border, another is being trained and one died of overdose. 

"Elephants are very sensitive and one can make a wrong calculation about the amount of tranquilisers sought to be injected into them from a distance. The quantity is calculated based on body weight. Only experts can guess the body weight and a slight overdose coupled with shock can prove fatal," a forest department official said. 

Meanwhile, the elephants which had kept forest officials and villages in border areas in both states on their toes have now moved towards Chandgad district of Maharashtra. "There is no immediate threat of them entering Goa, but we are keeping track," a Goa official said.
