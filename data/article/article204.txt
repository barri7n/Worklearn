DALTONGANJ: A female elephant found dead at the Khairahee waterhole in the Palamu Tiger Circle (PTC) on September 9/10 was poisoned to death. This was the first episode in the PTC where a female elephant had been so brutally poisoned to death, said PTC field director-cum-conservator of PTC S E H Kazmi.

Sources said the viscera of the elephant was sent to the State Forensic Laboratory (SFL) in Ranchi. Its report has reached the Palamu tiger project directorate.

Confirming this, Kazmi said, "The female elephant was poisoned to death." According to the SFL report, organo phosphate poison was used to kill this elephant.

Kazmi said the poison was highly deadly and gave tremendous pain and agony to wild animals. "The female elephant had marks of terrible agony on her body. The survival rate is dismal in such poisoning," he said.

The poison could have been mixed in the herbs with mahua and gur. Asked if this casualty of the elephant is the result of the man-animal conflict, Kazmi said, "Very much. This elephant became a victim of man's animosity."

Destruction of crop by elephants is very high and the Khairahee waterhole where this elephant was found dead has a huge human population in its vicinity.

The field director said an FIR was to be lodged and all efforts would be made to track the killers of this elephant as this was not the handiwork of just one or two people but a whole group. The project officials are trying to find out the owners/cultivators of fields where paddy was destroyed by the elephant as instant anger and revenge of these people had possibly taken a toll of the female elephant.

"The killing of this elephant is a pre-meditated and planned act of crime against wildlife and the culprit will be punished," he said.
