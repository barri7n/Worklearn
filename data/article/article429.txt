A 30-year-old male elephant was electrocuted in a village near Thalavadi in
Erode district of Tamil Nadu on Tuesday.

According to forest officials, the elephant was electrocuted when it tried
to enter a corn field in Muthiyanur village. The village is situated
adjacent to the Sathyamangalam Tiger Reserve.

"The owners of the field installed an electric fence. They did not obtain
permission from the concerned officials to set up the electric fence across
the field," they said.

The land owners were identified as S Maadevan, 48, and his brother, S
Gurusamy, 45.

"When we tried to nab the duo, they managed to escape. We have registered a
case against them and launched a search for them," the officials said.
