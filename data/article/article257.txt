A decomposed carcass of elephant found in the forest area of Rairangpur division in Mayurbhanj district has puzzled the forest officials. While the officials claim that the animal was not killed in the division, wildlife lovers and locals alleged that the elephant was killed by poachers. 
 
A team of forest officials led by Rairangpur DFO Arun Kumar Swain visited the spot inside Tendara reserve forest on Thursday and seized the carcass.  
 
â€œWe suspect that the animal was killed in Jharkhand forest area and its carcass thrown across the border. The animal may have died 10-15 days before. It might be a ploy to mount pressure on forest officials who are on strike since February 22,â€ he said. The villagers, however, said they had heard the noise of tuskers a few days before in the Reserve Forest close to Jharkhand  border. They informed the forest officials on Wednesday after they found the carcass. 
 
DFO said Regional Chief Conservator of Forests (RCCF) Anup Kumar Nayak has been informed about the incident and the carcass sent for forensic test.
