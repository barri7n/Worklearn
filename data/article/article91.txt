A 14-year-old female elephant died of electrocution in Rayong's Khao Chamao-Khao Wong National Park yesterday morning.

The body of Phang Sidor was found at 5.30am on a naked electrical cable on a rugged, muddy road 300 metres away from the Khlong Plu forest conservation unit. Nearby was a toad that had also died from electric shock.

Park director Sermphan Sariman said elephants had been foraging in farms near the forest and that it was suspected the beast had grabbed a bamboo supporting the cable. After a funeral ritual by nine monks, its body was transported by backhoe to a grave near the scene.
