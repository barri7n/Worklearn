Lahunipada: Forest officials Wednesday recovered the carcass of an elephant
from forest near Chhidakudar village under Banki forest range in Sundargarh
district.

The carcass bore injury marks on its back made by arrows with deep cuts on
its tusk.  Preliminary inquiries suggested the pachyderm might have been
killed by electrocution and shot by poison-laced arrows.

Its tail and hind nails were found trimmed with marks of blood noticed on
its mouth, ears and tusk. The matter came to the fore after locals noticed
the elephant lying dead and informed forest officials.

It was suspected that someone might have killed the elephant as a herd
strayed into the area and destroyed crops, K Bolang forester Harishchandra
Jena said.

However, the exact reason of the death could be ascertained after the
post-mortem report is available, Jena said.

On being informed, Banki ranger Salbinder Singh, ACF Dillip Kumar Sahu
reached the spot and took stock of the situation. The body was buried at
the spot after a veterinarian conducted a post-mortem.

Later, police officials reached the spot and joined the investigation but
failed to trace the killer. Notably, a few days back, forest officials and
police had seized two bundles of electric wires from the region.
