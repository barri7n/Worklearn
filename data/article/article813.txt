NAINITAL: Forest officials recovered the carcass of a female elephant from
Sarpudali range of Corbett Tiger Reserve (CTR) late on Wednesday night.
They suspect that the jumbo was killed in a tiger attack in the protected
area.

According to forest department sources, the carcass was also mutilated by
the big cat.

CTR director Rahul (who goes by his first name) said, “Preliminary
investigation into the death of the pachyderm indicates that it was killed
by a big cat, most probably a tiger. We have preserved the viscera of the
animal for further tests.”

Sources said that forest officials patrolling the area spotted the carcass
on Wednesday night and alerted higher authorities.

On information, senior officials rushed to the spot and sent the carcass
for postmortem. It was later cremated. Data available with the forest
department has revealed that nine elephants have died in the reserve this
year, of which four deaths were due to natural causes.

At least four elephants have died in Rajaji Tiger Reserve too. Speaking
about the rising number of jumbo deaths in Corbett, Nainital-based wildlife
activist Anup Sah said, “Apart from natural causes, many a time animals die
due to human factors. This is a serious threat to the ecological system of
the area.”
