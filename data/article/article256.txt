Two elephants were found dead in diff1TEerent parts of the State on Friday. While an adult cow elephant was found electrocuted to death in the Kosi range of Ramnagar division, a calf less than a year old was found dead in the Bijrani range of Corbett national park. 
 
According to the Corbett national park deputy director Saket Badola, the forest staff heard noise being made by an elephant herd in the Bijrani range of the national park on Friday morning. 
 
The staff visited the site later and found a dead elephant calf in compartment number four of the range. The body of the calf which was estimated to be about 3 to 6 months had no signs of external injuries and prima facie the death appeared to have been caused by natural factors. However, the exact cause of death would be known after the post mortem examination report is received, Badola  added. 
 
In the other incident a cow elephant estimated to be about 20 years, was found dead in the Kosi range of Ramnagar forest division adjoining Corbett. According to the divisional officials, the elephantâ€™s trunk showed signs of electrocution and a hi-tension overhead power line was passing through the area where the body was found. It is believed that the elephant was returning  from the river and its trunk hit the overhead hi-tension power line which was hanging low.
