A wild elephant suspected to be injured has taken shelter in a local forest
grove near Balale in Virajpet taluk of Kodagu district.

Locals say the elephant seemed to be limping around in a 12-acre forest
area close to the Lakshmanatheertha river.

Ranjan Poovaiah, former ZP member, said the Forest Department was informed
and it has decided to track the elephant and tranquilize and treat it if
necessary.

The elephant apparently was with a herd when it first emerged in the
village nearly six months ago. Though the herd returned to the forests, one
of them — suspected to be a female — stayed back. “Ever since it was found
in the grove, the elephant has stayed close to the lake and is most of the
time in the water. When it comes out, it limps towards the vegetation for
foraging only to return to the water again,” said Mr. Poovaiah.

Previous case

Last year, another wild elephant, Sidda, which was injured was found close
to Bengaluru. Following a hue and cry by wildlife activists, it was decided
to treat it. Even the Indian Army extended a helping hand and the Madras
Engineer Group (MEG) constructed a metallic structure to help balance the
elephant but to no avail.
