A wild elephant was found shot dead in a farm land bordering the forests at
Athirattukunnu under the Pathiri South section of the South Wayanad forest
division Sunday morning.

Forest officials said that the male elephant was around 20 years old and it
had three gunshot injuries in its body.

The killing has ringed alarm bells among forest officials and
conservationists as it is the third elephant to be gunned down in Wayanad
district in the last six months.

The carcass of the elephant was found lying in the paddy field by locals
early morning. Forest officials led by South Wayanad divisional forest
officer Abdul Azeez reached spot at 7 am. Steps are on to conduct the
autopsy.

The latest killing comes close on the heels of the arrest of a resort owner
in the last week of October for shooting down a wild elephant in
retaliation against the action taken by forest officials against his resort.

Locals said that there have been isolated incidents of crop raiding by
elephants in the region.
