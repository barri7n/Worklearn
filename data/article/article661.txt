GOALPARA: The Rongjuli range forest office in Assam's Goalpara district has
filed an FIR against Sofikur Rahman of Kheropara village in connection with
Wednesday's electrocution of an elephant in adjacent Satabari village, 50km
from here.

The 15-year-old female elephant was allegedly electrocuted in Rahman's
paddy field and a part of its trunk was taken away by goons.

The FIR was lodged on the basis of a statement by Ashwini Rabha, a resident
of Satabari, from whose house Rahman had taken the connection to his field.

Forest ranger Balen Das said, "During our joint investigation with police,
we found that a live electric wire that was encircling a paddy field took
the life of the animal." Quoting Rabha he said the electric connection was
taken to the paddy field by Sofikur.

Das said a 50- bigha wetland attached to the forest is illegally used for
cultivation by the locals. "This encroachment blocks an elephant corridor
and the free movement of the animals, leading to man-animal conflict," he
said.

The investigation also shed light on other significant issues.

Gul Bahadur, accused of tree felling and timber smuggling, has been
appointed by police as a local village defence volunteer secretary.

He has been instrumental in encroachment of the forest areas cleared by the
department in February. "From next year, we won't let anyone cultivate in
forest wetlands.

Even if they do, they will be bound by contract not to oppose elephants
grazing their paddy fields," DFO Acharya Goswami said.
