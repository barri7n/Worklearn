BHUBANESWAR: Wildlife officials were caught napping after poachers struck twice killing an elephant and a boar in Chandaka Wildlife Sanctuary near here on Saturday.

Both the incidents took place in the bordering areas of Haldia and Damapara forest ranges inside the sanctuary.

According to sources, a female elephant was hunted by poachers. Some forest officials were inspecting the spot when they heard gun shots. While tracking the sound, they came across two persons carrying the carcass of a boar.

However, the poachers managed to flee seeing the forest officials. Post-mortem reports said, the boar was shot twice from a country-made gun.

However, elephant's death was shrouded in mystery. While officials maintained that it could be a case of electrocution or poisoning by villagers trying to save their crops, some suggested that it could be killed for its teeth.

Female elephants don't have tusks unlike male ones, but have teeth.

Chief Wildlife Warden S.C. Mohanty said initial reports found that it could be a case of killing to stop the pachyderm from damaging crops.

However, poaching for the teeth cannot be ruled out, though the animal's teeth were not well developed.

He said the forest officials are combing the area and would soon nab the culprits. Strong action would be taken against the erring forest officials, he added.

"It is shocking as both the animals were killed under the Haldia range. We will take appropriate action against the erring officials," he said.
