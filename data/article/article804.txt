SHIVAMOGGA: A female elephant calf that was rescued from Yettinahole in
Sakleshpur of Hassan district was shifted to the Sakrebailu elephant camp
in Shivamogga on Friday evening.

With this, the number of elephant calfs in the camp has risen to four. The
entire staff at Sakrebailu elephant camp are happy about the entry of the
calf.

Their job to ‘tame’ this wild elephant has already begun.

The calf was born to the wild elephant that was recently trapped in slush
near Kadagaravalli village of Sakleshpur taluk.

Though the elephant was rescued, she succumbed to her injuries on November
28.

So, senior forest department officials had decided to shift the baby to
Sakrebailu elephant camp. As per the directions of forest officers, a team
of six, including mahouts, jamedar and kavadis went to Yettinahole to
escort the calf.
