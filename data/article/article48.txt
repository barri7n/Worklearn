FOUR wild elephants drunk on beer were electrocuted when they stumbled into a power pole and brought it down on top of themselves in northeast India.

Elephants are known to have a taste for the rice beer brewed by tribes across northeast India.

A herd of up to 25 elephants rampaged in a remote area in the West Garo Hills district earlier this week, forcing villagers to run for cover and leave their freshly brewed beverage behind, BBC News online reported.

After drinking the village dry, the elephants ran into a power pole, bringing it down.

Their trunks bore the brunt of the shock from the high-tension wire and four elephants were killed instantly, the website said.

Elephant expert Kushal Konwar Sharma, an Assam  lecturer, said elephants frequently drank rice beer and caused devastation when they became intoxicated.

Wildlife officials said that in the last two years elephants had killed at least 180 people in Assam and Meghalaya, and more than 200 elephants had been killed by angry villagers in the last six years.
