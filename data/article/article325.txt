CHITTOOR: An angry herd of elephants kept on trumpeting and roaring for
hours together scaring away people living in nearby hamlets in the forest
area of Ramakuppam in Chittoor district on Friday after one of its members
died due to electric shock.

The herd consisting of 13 pachyderms was crossing the agricultural fields
at Ramapuram tanda of Nakkalgutta in the forest area of Ramakuppam when an
elephant came in contact with a live electric wire set up by poachers to
trap wild boars and deer.

As the elephant lay dead, the other members in the herd surrounded it and
started trumpeting loudly. The wails echoed in the forests causing panic
among nearby villagers. Some of them ran for safety. A forest officials
team visited the spot and advised people against venturing near the angry
elephants

The trumpeting continued for hours. Even forest officials did not go near
the herd. Later, senior forest officials conducted panchanama and sent the
dead elephant for post mortem. A case has been registered. About 30
elephants have been camping in the forest area in Chittoor district for the
last 25 days. Last week, a herd of elephants disrupted train traffic on the
busy Chennai-Bangalore rail road by squatting on the railway tracks.

Forest officials point out that elephants have started liking juicy
tomatoes that are grown in the border areas of Chittoor district, which
otherwise is not a traditional habitat of the pachyderms.
