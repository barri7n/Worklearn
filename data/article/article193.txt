BALANGIR: A 12 year-old wild elephant died after being electrocuted in Barghat reserve forest under Patnagarh range, about 60 kilometer from here on Thursday afternoon. The incident is reported to have taken place following yesterday's strong wind that caused two electric posts to collapse on the ground in the area.

"Preliminary investigation revealed that the elephant which died in the electric shock might have come out of the reserve forest area and come in contact with live wire lying on the road", said DFO (Balangir) R K Sahu. He, however said that postmortem only can reveal the exact cause of death. He said it was an old male elephant. Going by the habits, this elephant should be found moving in a herd.

Post mortem of the elephant will be done at the Patnagarh veterinary hospital. After the incident the forest department officials rushed to the spot to take stock.
