MALAPPURAM: The decomposed carcass of a wild elephant has been found in
Thenpara area of Nadukani pass near Vazhikkadavu in the district.

The medical examination of the corpse has found a huge pile of plastic
waste which came out of the elephant’s intestine. Veterinary surgeon D.
Ramachandran said the consumption of a large amount of the plastic waste
could be the cause of jumbo’s death. The carcass was at least three months
old. The age of the animal seems to be around 26 years, he said.

The body was decomposed. According to forest officials, this was the first
wild elephant died after consuming plastic wastes.

The carcass found almost near to a place in Nadukani pass where tourists
and passengers used to take a break. They dump plastic wastes including
bottles of soft drinks and packets of food items here carelessly which has
become a threat to wild animals in the forest region.

by the forest officials.
