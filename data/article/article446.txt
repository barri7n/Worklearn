Hundreds of villagers in India gathered together to mourn the death of an
elephant that died after being electrocuted when it wandered into community
looking for something to eat.

People decorated the elephant's body with paints and plants as part of
prayers as it was laid to rest and buried in a massive grave on Sunday at
Chakrapani village in the Kamrup district of Assam, India.

Local reports claim the massive mammal was killed after coming into contact
with one of the community's unauthorized electric wires especially erected
and hidden by the villagers to keep away the wild elephants.

It is understood the Asiatic elephant had strayed near a storehouse where
it had attempted to eat some paddy rice when it inadvertently touched the
high voltage fence.

An official said that the scarcity of food and the illegal encroachment of
forest areas nearby may have forced the wild beast to desperately seek out
food in a populated area.
