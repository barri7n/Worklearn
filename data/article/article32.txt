Jakarta , March . 12 (BNA) Indonesian environmentalists have demanded an investigation into the death of two more wild Sumatran elephants at a training centre in the eastern province of Riau, local media reports said today.
The wild elephants were killed for their tusks, said Nurcholis Fadlli, of the Worldwide Life for Nature (WWF) in the Riau capital of Pekanbaru. The state-run news agency Antara quoted Fadli as accusing an unnamed official at the elephant-training centre at Hutan Raya forestry park for the killings, after the beasts were captured in Siak district. Local government authorities in Riau have recently rounded up wild elephants following a series of rampages, destroying farmlands and injuring local residents.
