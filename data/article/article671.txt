COIMBATORE: A male elephant was electrocuted in Nellidurai in Mettupalayam
forest range on early Sunday morning.

Initially, it was suspected that the elephant, which was nearly
30-year-old, died of suffocation after it fell into an elephant proof
trench (EPT). However, the post-mortem reports on Sunday evening concluded
that the elephant was electrocuted.

A senior official of the forest department said, "The elephant died during
the wee hours of Sunday. The department officers who were patrolling in the
area around 10.30am informed us."

Another forest department official said, "Initially it looked like the
elephant fell into the trench and died of suffocation." He added, "Later,
when post-mortem reports concluded that it died of electrocution we
realized that it fell into the trench due to electrocution."

The area is frequented by elephants, the forest officials said. "Last year,
two elephants died in the same region (within a 5km radius)," the official
said. The live wire that electrocuted the elephant is said to be hanging
from a pole that was set to prevent entry of elephants, they added.
