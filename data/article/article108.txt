Angul (Orissa), Oct 26 (PTI) An elephant calf was electrocuted in Talcher forest range of Orissa's Angul district today.

The incident occurred at Arakhpal village when the four-year-old female calf came in contact with a low-lying 33-KV line passing through the route, official sources said here.

The calf was believed to have got separated from an elephant herd before the mishap.

This is the second such incident in the same forest range after the mishap at nearby Bairakuan last week where another female calf died after coming in contact with a live electric wire.

Attributing the mishaps to alleged damage of the elephant corridor between Tikarapara sanctuary to Baruan in Angul district, wildlife lovers hoped that steps would be taken for safe movement of the pachyderms on their route.
