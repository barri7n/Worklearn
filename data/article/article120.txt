JAKARTA â€” Poachers are suspected to have killed an endangered Sumatran elephant whose body was discovered by villagers with its tusks removed, Indonesian conservationists said Wednesday.



"We also found a stab wound on the right side of the chest, piercing through his liver," Mulyo Utomo from the nature conservation agency in Sumatra's Riau province told AFP.



The 10-year-old male elephant's body was found in Petani village in Riau province.



Conflicts between wild elephants and humans are on the rise on Sumatra, where settlements, plantations and industrial forest estates are rapidly reducing their natural habitat.



There are about 2,400 to 2,800 Sumatran elephants in Indonesia, of which 200 to 250 are in Riau, according to environmental group WWF. They are the smallest of the Asian elephants.
