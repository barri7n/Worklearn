ROURKELA (Orissa): A wild elephant was electrocuted at Arjunda village in Kanika forest range of Sundergarh, 150 km from here, while a man was killed in tusker attack elsewhere in the district.
Police said in the first incident a pachyderm, aged 20-25 years, came in contact with a low-lying overhead 11 KV line while roaming outside the village on Sunday night.
On hearing its screams, villagers gathered but found that the tusker had already died.
Sundergarh Divisional Forest Officer (DFO) B N Thakur along with police visited the spot. The pachyderm was buried outside the village after a post-mortem.
The villagers had complained that such incidents were frequent due to low-lying high tension lines in rural areas.
In another incident, a 55-year-old man, Ray Gadia Munda was trampled to death by a wild elephant at Bambundia village under Sundergarh Sadar police limit, about 140 km from here on Monday night.
Police said while Munda died on the spot, his nephew escaped unhurt. Forest officials reached the village and promised financial assistance to the family.
