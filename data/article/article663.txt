KOTA KINABALU: Yet another Borneo Pygmy Elephant was found dead from bullet
wounds at an oil palm estate at a plantation near Kalabakan in Tawau.

The bull elephant, with its tusks intact, was likely shot by poachers said,
Sabah Wildlife Department Director Augustine Tuuga, Thursday.

"The tusk is still intact and post-mortem result found three bullets on the
carcass. The elephant could have been shot elsewhere and fled.

"We are trying to track down the culprit and are also looking for those who
witnessed the shooting incident, so they can furnish us with information,"
he said.

In August, plantation workers also spotted an adult Bornean pygmy elephant
struggling for its life after sustaining multiple gunshot wounds in an oil
palm plantation the Malua Forest Reserve in Kinabatangan.

The adult female elephant, however, succumbed to its injuries.

An elephant carcass was found in a plantation near Dumpas in Kalabakan and
weeks later another was found floating along the Kinabatangan river close
to the Danau Girang Field Research Centre.

Both carcasses were found without their tusks.
