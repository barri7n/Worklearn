November 24, 2010: A giant tusker, corralled from Galgamuwa, died last night when the floor boards of the lorry in which he was being transported, gave way resulting in the pachyderm crashing on to the tarmac causing mortal wounds.



â€œThe Galgamuwa Tusker was being taken to a reserve when the tragedy occurred around 8pm at Thambuttegama,â€ said Veterinarian Tharaka Prasad, Acting Deputy Director of the Wild Life Department.



Attempts had been made to release the elephant to the Siyambalangamuwa area in an effort to save his life, but the effort had failed, said Dr. Prasad.



The elephant, with tusks about 5 feet long, is considered the pachyderm in the wilds with the longest pair of tusks.



The tusker had killed a woman and attacked three others in the Mahagalgamuwa, Koneweva and Ganedivelwewa areas during the last few days. The Wild Life officials took measures to corral the elephant thereafter.
