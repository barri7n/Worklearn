JORHAT: Two elephants were electrocuted in the Thuramukh area of Golaghat forest range early on Tuesday. Forest staff found the carcasses of the pachyderms at a paddy field in the area.

Forest range officer (Golaghat) Sanjiv Bordoloi said the elephants were found dead after being electrocuted by a live wire passing over a paddy field in the area. "The jumbos died on the spot," he said.

He added, "Both the elephants were adult males and they went out from the nearby Nambor Reserve Forest to the Thuramukh area in search of food. They also damaged more than 10 houses in the area in the early hours on Tuesday and were on their way back to the forest when the incident took place."

Last year, another elephant that come from Nambor reserve forest was electrocuted in the same area of the district when the trunk of the elephant accidentally touched a high voltage wire while the animal was passing through the Thuramukh tea garden.

In 2010, forest staff found the carcass of another wild elephant in the Kukurakata Reserve Forest in the Burapahar forest range of Kaziranga National Park after it got electrocuted by touching a high-voltage wire.

"Due to shortage of food in the hills, elephants in large numbers come out of Nambor reserve regularly and visit Thuramukh and its adjacent areas. They damage houses every night to get edibles. More than three persons have died in elephant attacks here this year and many others sustained severe injuries,'' a villager said.
