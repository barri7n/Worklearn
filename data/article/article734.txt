Police have launched manhunt operations against poachers who killed one
wild elephant in Par Paw village in Singu township in Mandalay Region.

The elephant, estimated to be 40 years old, was killed on Saturday
according to villagers, U Tint Swe, director of the Mandalay Region
Department of Forestry told The Myanmar Timeson Monday.

“The elephant was killed by a poisoned arrow fired from a percussion rifle.
As the site is near a residential area, tusk and skin were not removed and
taken from the dead elephant. We are investigating the incident in
cooperation with the police,” U Tint Swe said.

“In March, one wild elephant was also killed in nearby Thabeikkyin
township. Elephant killings are quite frequent in our areas. There are some
preventive measures that have been initiated but killings,” an official of
Singu township Department of Forestry, who requested anonymity, said.

Combined teams of police and Department of Forestry officials have been
dispatched to hunt down the suspects and a case was opened under section 41
(a) of the Biodiversity and Protected Areas Law at Letpanhla police station
by the forest department.

“As the areas in Thabeikkyin and Singu are surrounded by forests, many wild
elephants dwell there. So there are also many poachers. With the help of
the police, these poachers could be arrested if they can be pursued deep
into the jungle,” a resident from Letpanhla village U Thaung Tun said.

The Department of Forestry said seven wild elephants have been killed in
Mandalay Region over the last two years.
