A male elephant has been found dead at the Way Kambas National Park in Lampung with both its trunks missing, kompas.com reported Tuesday.

The park’s director, John Kenedie, said Tuesday the two-year-old elephant may have been poisoned. Park officials found him dead at his cage at about 2 a.m. on last Friday.

“The thieves might have fed him with food that was laced with rodenticide,” John said; adding that the thieves were probably familiar with the park.

The trunks weigh close to 70 kilograms and are valued at tens of millions of rupiah.

Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) activist M. Gio said trunk hunters are now targeting elephants bred in national parks due to the dwindling population of wild elephants.

The Way Kambas park covers 125,000 hectares of land and is home to 250 elephants.
