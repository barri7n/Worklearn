Another wild elephant died of gunshot injuries despite attempts by the Sri Lanka Army and the Wildlife Conservation Officers to save its life. The injured jumbo with serious gunshot injuries was lying in a shrub jungle in Panama on the boundary of the Kudumbigala National Park when the Wildlife Conservation Officials went to the aid of the stricken elephant and provided treatment with the help of the Sri Lanka Army. The officials said the elephant had a serious injury in the throat caused by an explosive device called â€˜Hakka Patasâ€™ and gunshot injuries in the legs. The well grown male elephant was about 20 years of age and 8ft tall. Veterinary surgeon of the Ampara Wildlife Conservation Office Dr Pramuditha Devasurendra performed the postmortem examination. He said two wild elephants in Ampara Wildlife Range died of gunshot injuries during the last week.
