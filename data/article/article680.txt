TEZPUR: Two elephants were electrocuted in Assam's Nagaon district on
Monday night after coming into contact with an 11kV wire.

The incident occurred near the Assam Power Distribution Company Limited at
Samaguri Gandhali Kachari Gaon.

"The elephants, which were more than nine-foot tall, were coming from Karbi
Anglong in search of food. They were moving in a paddy field when their
trunks came in contact with the low-lying electric line and they were
electrocuted," a forest official said.

He said action would be taken against the power company.

Senior forest officials will discuss the issue of electrocution of
elephants at a high-level meeting convened by Dispur on Wednesday.

On December 8, an elephant had got electrocuted in Hojai while passing
through a paddy field as the contractor had diverted a transmission line.
On December 10, five elephants were knocked down by a speeding train near a
tea garden in Sonitpur district.

The government has no policy on preventing deaths of animals because of
train accidents and electrocution.

Former Union minister of state (independent charge) of environment, forest
and climate change, late Lagte Anil Madhav Dave, had informed the Rajya
Sabha last year that there was no policy with the government to formulate
such a policy.
