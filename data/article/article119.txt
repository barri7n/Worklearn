Two elephants were electrocuted Monday when they bumped into high tension wires in Jharkhand's Khuti district, an official said Monday.



The incident took place near Nimidin village, some 60 km from here.



District forest officer Manel Tudu said elephants come regularly to the area in search of wheat crops. 'It seems one elephant hit an electric pole and snapped the high tension wires.'



More than 70 elephants have reportedly died in Jharkhand in the last nine years due to several reasons including electrocution.
