A wild elephant that had been saved from drowning in the sea off Sampur in Trincomalee a few months ago by the Sri Lanka Navy and released to the jungle was found dead last night in a well in Jayanthipura in Trincomalee. 



Few months ago the elephant had been caught in a current and swept farther into the deep sea when the Navy spotted it. The jumbo had been roaming in the Sampur and Trincomalee areas and was being monitored by the Wildlife Conservation officials.



The residents of the area said the bull-elephant had fallen into the recently dug up well at about 10.30 pm on Monday night. They said the jumbo with a huge body had been trapped in the well without being able to move about.
