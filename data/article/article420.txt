The carcass of a full-grown elephant was found at Nayagram in West
Midnapore district today.

A senior forest official said the male tusker could have died after coming
in contact with a 1000 volt high-tension wire passing by in the vicinity.

The jumbo, which was believed to have strayed from Dalma forest range
nearby, was part of the about 12-member elephant herd roaming in the area
for the past few days, the official said.

The carcass was set ablaze after autopsy on the river bank of Subarnarekha
nearby.

The incident followed the finding of an elephant carcass at Salboni in the
same district last month.
