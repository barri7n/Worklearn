The ailing tusker which was rescued in a critical condition from Asurakhol
in Odishaâ€™s Deogarh district died on Saturday while undergoing treatment.

According to reports, the elephant was found in Tileibani forest range with
deep injuries on his head. Veterinary experts were called in and the
pachyderm was under supervision of a team of specialists from Odisha
University of Agriculture and Technology (OUAT) since Monday in Asurakhol
village under Prabhasuni Reserve Forest range in the district.

However, he slipped into coma last night and succumbed after battling for
life for nearly a week.

The jumbo was rescued from a nullah with the help of a crane and was under
treatment since then.

During post-mortem, a 7.5 cm arrow was removed from the head of the
elephant which suggests that poachers might have shot him.

Meanwhile, Forest Department officials have launched an inquiry into the
matter.

It may be mentioned here that at least five elephants have died in the last
four months in this particular region.
