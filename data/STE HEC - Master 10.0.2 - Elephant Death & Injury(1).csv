Four wild Asian elephants that got drunk on rice beer have been electrocuted 
in the northern Indian state of Meghalaya.

A forest official said a herd of about 24 elephants went on the rampage in a 
remote area in the West Garo Hills district.

""The elephants, after getting high on rice beer, started dashing against an 
electric pole. A live wire fell, killing four elephants instantly,"" said the 
official.

Wild elephants have been targeting areas in Meghalaya and the adjoining 
state of Assam where people brew large volumes of rice beer, reports the 
Kerala Nextwebsite.

""We have come across devastating drunken bouts by herds that have developed 
a liking for country liquor,"" said Kushal Konwar Sharma, a noted elephant 
expert.

In the last two years, elephants have killed at least 180 people in Assam 
and Meghalaya. Angry villagers, in turn, have killed up to 200 of the 
animals.

The last elephant census in 1999 recorded 7,200 wild elephants in Assam and 
Meghalaya, more than half of India's count of 10,000.",1

Two farm assistants have been taken into custody by special teams of the 
Forest department in connection with the electrocution of a tusker and a 
female elephant at two places in the Coimbatore reserve forest division. One 
incident was reported on Saturday night and the other on Sunday. The female 
elephant was killed at Palapatti near the Sirumugai reserve forest area off 
Mettuppalayam, when it tried to stray into a farm, where cabbage, tobacco 
and plantain crops were raised. At Anaimedu in the Boluvampatti forest area, 
a 20-year-old tusker was electrocuted.

Talking to The Hindu, the District Forest Officer, P. Durairasu, said that 
with the depletion of buffer land, which falls between farm and forest land, 
elephants regularly strayed into farms in search of food and water.

He appealed to farmers to refrain from cultivating crops, which attracted 
elephants, and sought a change in the cropping pattern at least on forest 
fringes. The farmers were expected to register with the Forest department, 
the Electricity Board and the district administration before they went for 
electric fencing.

using battery or solar power had come into light. The animals stray into 
farms only after dusk or early morning and the farmers provide the

Pekanbaru, Jan 29 (ANTARA) - Two male elephants were found dead after being 
poisoned by unidentified persons at spot near the elephant training center 
(PTL) in Duri area, Bengkalis district, Riau, recently.

Chairman of a local non-governmental organization on wildlife, Gamatra, said 
here on Thursday the two giant animals were found with their tusks gone. ""I 
think the killers were professionals working for a syndicate,"" he said.

It was assumed the killers were members of an elephant-killing syndicate as 
the tusks had been cut without hurting the elephants, he said.

In addition, female elephants wandering in the location were left untouched. 
""This is an indication that the killers only wanted to get the tusks because 
female elephants don't have tusks,"" he said.

Their modus operandi in killing elephants was by putting poison inside 
pineapples. The sample of poison had been taken to a laboratory in Bukit 
Tinggi for further examination.

Named 'Kola' and 'Amid', the two dead elephants were aged between 15 and 20 
years.",1

Bandar Lampung, Lampung, Jan 29 (ANTARA) - A number of environmental 
activists in Indonesia's Lampung province have urged concerned agencies to 
look into the killing of four elephants at the Bukit Barisan National Park, 
a spokesman has said.

The remains of the four elephants (elephas maximus sumatrensis, sp) were 
found near the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) research center within 
the premises of the park in Bengkunat subdistrict, West Lampung district, 
executive director of the non-governmental organization, WATALA, Joko 
Santoso said here Thursday.

The call to investigate the killing of the elephants has already been 
conveyed by WATALA, the Lampung Forest Conservation Consortium, the 
Indonesian Alas Foundation and WCS to the provincial administration, he 
said.

Joko said poachers have been killing such endangered animals as 
rhinoceroses, tigers and elephants and have been stealing parts of their 
bodies for money.

WCS researchers who found the remains of the four elephants saw that their 
tusks were missing, he said.

Joko said researchers sometimes hear gunshots as they do their tasks at the 
park.

Head of the park's management office, Tamen Sitorus, confirmed the death of 
the four elephants.

""Four elephants have died of illegal hunting,"" he said, adding that about 
600 elephants live at the national park.",1

Wildlife Protection Society of India Press Release
27 February 2004

Carelessness and negligence continue to take the lives of India’s wild 
animals. On 20 February 2004, around midnight, a wild tusker was 
electrocuted to death in an orchard in Mishar Pura village, under Kankhal 
Police Station, Haridwar, Uttaranchal.

According to preliminary reports received by the Wildlife Protection Society 
of India (WPSI), the orchard caretaker discovered the death at 7 a.m. on 21 
February, and informed the electricity department. At that time, the wire 
was still live. The electricity department finally shut down the power 
around 9 a.m. and then arrived at the spot.

The tragic death was easily preventable. The Uttaranchal Power Corporation 
had been carrying out maintenance work on an 11,000 KV power line running 
through the orchard. The contractor hired for the job neglected to secure 
the wires at the required height of 4 metres and left them dangling at 7 to 
8 feet. It was a tragedy waiting to happen when the tusker walked straight 
into the low slung wire.

The elephant was one of a group of young tuskers that would regularly cross 
the Tircha Bridge at Shyampur on their way to the Ganga. A WPSI project 
officer photographed the tuskers in October 2003.

Wild animal mortalities by electrocution  both accidental and deliberate  
have reached staggering proportions in India. WPSI presently has records of 
more than 257 large wild mammals that have been electrocuted in the last 14 
years. In the year 2003 alone, 28 elephants and six tigers died due to 
electrocution.

The Honourable Central Empowered Committee (CEC) of the Supreme Court of 
India is currently hearing a petition filed by WPSI on the electrocution of 
wild animals throughout India. The respondents, which include the Ministry 
of Power, Ministry of Environment and Forests and several State Electricity 
Boards, have been asked to work out a solution in collaboration with WPSI.

In yet another case of alleged cruelty to elephants by ill-trained mahouts, 
a domesticated 45-year-old elephant died at Mannarakottappady, near 
Kulanada, on the Kaippuzha-Panangad Road on Monday evening.

The elephant, Manikantan, belonged to a timber merchant who runs a sawmill 
at Panangad. The pachyderm was reportedly taken for a bath to the nearby 
river. According to eyewitnesses, the elephant was beaten up badly by the 
mahouts when it showed signs of hesitation to enter the river.

The pachyderm reportedly turned a little violent when it was tortured to get 
into the river waters. They said all the three mahouts attending on the 
tusker were in an inebriated state and had tortured the elephant in their 
efforts to get it out of the river too. A large number of local people had 
gathered on the riverbank to witness the incident when the elephant turned 
violent.

They said the mahouts had hit the elephant with rock pieces and sharp iron 
implements.

The pachyderm with contusion all over the body and cut injuries on the leg 
was tamed', later, and was taken to the road around 3 p.m. The tusker was 
reportedly found weary and it collapsed when it reached Mannarakkottupady 
near Kaippuzha Elanjickalkavu, the local people said.

Meanwhile, the three mahouts escaped from the scene after sensing the death 
of the elephant. The tusker's carcass was lying on the road till it was 
reportedly removed to an unknown' destination by some unidentified people 
late in the night, the local people said.

Ironically, the police at Pandalam are feigning innocence saying that no 
complaint had been registered in this connection so far.

Meanwhile, the reporter of a local daily was allegedly manhandled by the 
owner of the elephant when the former sought details of the mahouts. The 
owner was not willing to disclose the identity of the mahouts.",1

The Hindu
March 25, 2004

A dynamite concealed in fodder exploded in the mouth of an elephant calf, 
ripping its face apart and leaving the hapless creature writhing in agony 
until it died on Wednesday.

The incident is suspected to have taken place two days ago near Hediyala 
village on the fringes of the Bandipur National Park. The injured elephant 
calf was first noticed by a few villagers near Heidyala. They brought the 
injured animal to the Mysore zoo for treatment on Wednesday.

Veterinarians, who examined the animal, found that the tongue had been blown 
off and the face mangled. They said that the elephant calf was in a critical 
condition and since infection had set in, death was imminent.

Even as the villagers were shifting the elephant calf, it collapsed and 
died.

The incident brings to light the growing intolerance towards animals among 
some people living on the fringes of the Bandipur and Nagarahole national 
parks, where the man-animal conflict has increased due to water and fodder 
scarcity.

Though studies on elephant killings across the country have documented the 
death of the animals by electrocution, poisoning, shooting, and spearing (in 
a few tribal dominated States), the gruesome method of warding off animals 
from plantations by hiding explosives in fodder is a new and a growing 
phenomenon in South India.

Though poaching of elephants for ivory has reduced after the International 
Union for Conservation of Nature imposed a ban on ivory trade, 
conservationists in India are worried about the alarming rise in the death 
of elephants due to the man-animal conflict.

In the region bordering Karnataka and Kerala, explosives are packed in 
jackfruit or other edibles and when the elephants bite the bait, it triggers 
of an explosion maiming the hapless animal, which dies a slow and painful 
death. The death of the baby elephant from Hediyala range is a case in 
point.

Given the increase in the man-animal conflict and the growing intolerance 
towards wildlife, conservation biologists are worried that the elephant 
population in Bandipur-Nagarahole-Wynad-Mudumalai range may come down.

The region has the highest density of elephants in Asia, and it is estimated 
that the combined area spread over 55000 sq. km. harbours at least 8,000 to 
10,000 elephants.

But the growing intolerance towards wildlife has put a question mark on 
their future.",1

A 20-year-old elephant has been battling for life for the past three days in

After being chased by angry villagers for destroying their crop, the 
elephant collapsed when his legs gave way under him.

In a strange twist, the villagers are now feeling guilty and are trying to 
find ways to restore him to health.

""This elephant is deformed and it's not able to walk. That is why it could 
not collect the necessary amount of food due to weakness,"" says Dilip Beura, 
range office, Keonjhar.

Over the past five years, besides destroying acres of crops and several 
homes in Keonjhar district, 60 people have been killed by elephants.

But despite all that, villagers here are upset at what the animal had to go 
through.

wheat fields. We drove it away but now we feel bad about it. We've tried to 
revive it by offering water and fodder but it's not responding,"" says 
Kangali Parida of Tankujoda village.

The growth of industrial and mining activity has had an adverse effect on 
Orissa's traditional elephant corridor, which connects Singhbhum and 
Keonjhar districts.

Dhaka - An elephant was killed in Bangladesh by an electrified fence built 
to protect crops as he mourned the death of a herd member electrocuted by 
the same barrier, an official said on Thursday.

One elephant was killed on Monday by the fence erected by locals to keep the 
elephants from destroying rice crops, a forest officer said.

The second was electrocuted on Tuesday as it returned with a herd of more 30 
to the spot and dug up the body of the first elephant buried by forest 
staff.

""They were mourning the death of their beloved mate. It's a very sad thing 
but it shows the strong tie of friendship among those wild animals,"" said 
divisional forest officer Abdul Latif Mia.

'They were mourning the death of their beloved mate'
The two elephants were killed in Sherpur district near the border with 
India's Meghalaya state.

Scientists believe elephants mourn their dead.

In May around 100 elephants were reported to have wailed loudly for three 
days after one of their herd was killed by poachers in south-eastern 
Bangladesh.

Elephants frequently damage property and crops in north-eastern India and 
Bangladesh, where loss of their natural habitat to population encroachment 
has brought them into conflict with humans.

Villagers have also been killed trying to protect their homes and crops from 
elephants.",1

JAKARTA (AP): Six wild elephants were poisoned to death in Sumatra after the 
endangered animals encroached on a palm oil plantation, police said on 
Monday.

The killing of elephants as well as endangered tigers are common place on 
the island, where illegal logging and farming have shrunk their natural 
reserves and increased clashes with humans.

The elephants were found dead near the Rokan Hulu forest in Riau province 
about 1,050 kilometers (652 miles) northwest of the capital Jakarta. 
Plantation workers admitted to sickening them with rat poison.

""The wild elephants have become a big problem for us and we had no other 
choice than to poison them so we could secure the plantation,"" said Lindung 
Nasution, one of the workers.

Police are investigating the deaths. No arrests have been made. (**)",1

Poachers have killed a rare pygmy elephant on Malaysian Borneo and removed 
its tusks, according to a report citing a wildlife official.

It is the second time in less than two months that a pygmy elephant in 
Malaysia's Sabah state on Borneo island has been slaughtered by poachers.

The New Sunday Times newspaper said the carcass of an adult male pygmy 
elephant was discovered near Lahad Datu on the east coast of the state some 
10 days ago. It had been shot dead and its tusks were sawn off.

Police have detained a 19-year-old local and seized a homemade shotgun and a 
spent shell not far from where the carcass was found, it said.

District Wildlife Officer Stephen Gibin Sira said the elephant was part of a 
herd of about 40 elephants from the Ulu Segama Forest.

In the earlier incident, which happened in the same district, a male pygmy 
elephant was shot and killed and its tusks sawn off and hind legs butchered 
for meat.",1

Dhaka, Mar 5 (UNI) Human instincts are sometimes more deadly for animals 
than vice versa, as exemplified by the ''bestial'' attack by a mob on an 
elephant in Bangladesh's southeastern Cox's Bazar district.

Th mob attacked the wild elephant, who entered the area in search of food, 
with hot iron rods and powdered chilli on Wednesday, injuring and blinding 
him.

Large amounts of chilli powder were thrown into the helpless animal's eyes 
with the sole purpose of selling its parts and with total disregard for the 
consequences.

After the brutal attack, the nearly-blind animal slipped into a pond. Later, 
the elephant clambered up and crashed into trees repeatedly as it moved 
blindly to and fro, wailing in pain.

Local people of the coastal area, anguished by the elephant's suffering, 
expressed the apprehension that the elephant could die within a short time 
and the miscreants were just biding their time.

Forest officials said the injured elephant moved into the deep forest on 
Thursday, but could not say anything about its present condition.

Meanwhile, three elephants were killed by hunters in Ramu and nearby 
Naikhangchhari sub-district in the last two weeks.

It was probably incidents like these which were on Mahatma Gandhi's mind 
when he said ''the more helpless a creature, the more entitled it is to 
protection by man from the cruelty of man.''

The world famous Jim Corbett National Park suffered a major loss when the 
park lost one of its Elephants after it was electrocuted.

The elephant was killed due to electrocution on the outskirts of the 
national park.

The elephants from the park venture out to the nearby fields, adjoining the 
national park, and at times destroy the crops of the villagers. This led to 
certain villagers putting up electrified fences to prevent the elephants 
from venturing into and destroying their crops and fields. These fences are 
usually linked upto the high tension wires, which means that any contact 
with them leads to instant death due to electrocution.

The field where this elephant died belonged to one Khuttu Singh. Singh was 
earlier advised by the forest officials to not to lay electrified fencing, 
but he never paid heed to their request.

The wire used was a thin wire, which was not easy to be seen. The elephant 
strayed into Khuttu's field at night and could not see the high-tension 
electric wire. The trunk of the elephant came in contact with the wire, 
which led to the death of the animal, explained the divisional forest 
officer, S.S. Rasaily.

""This incident happened in the western forest region, near the Nampukhra 
range, in gobipura village. This land is attached to our range. For many 
days we were getting information about elephants straying into these parts 
and our staff was repeatedly monitoring the area. So we came to know that 
the owner of the field, Khuttu Singh, had laid down wires here, which was 
carrying electricity. We even tried to convince him, not to do such a thing. 
Three days back also our staff came here and removed these wires, but during 
the night these wires were relayed. And, in the night time these elephants 
came here and got electrocuted"", he added.

The landowner, Khuttu Singh, is now being charged under the Wildlife 
Protection Act of 1972, and is set to be prosecuted soon.",1

Statesman News Service COOCH BEHAR, Feb. 14. - A three-member commission is 
probing into the killing of an elephant, whose body was recently found in 
the Chilapata forest in the Cooch Behar forest division area. The body of a 
full-grown tusker was recovered from the CC Line area of Chilapata Forest 
Range near the Jaldapara forest on 4 February. It was probably killed on 2 
February. The poachers went underground after chopping off its trunk and two 
tusks. The length of each of the tusks is about five feet.

The commission was constituted following an instruction from state forest 
minister Mr Jogesh Chandra Barman. Chief conservator of forests (wildlife) 
Mr Ujjwal Bhattacharya, conservator of forests (wildlife-North) Mr PT Bhutia 
and conservator of forests (Northern circle) Mr LG Lepcha are the members of 
the panel. Chief minister Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had expressed his 
displeasure over the poaching incident. Following the incident, Mr Jogesh 
Chandra Barman ordered an inquiry and half-a-dozen members of the gang have 
been arrested. The severed tusks have also been recovered from a place at 
Sachin basti of Uttar Mendabari.

Interrogating the arrested, the forest officials learnt that the elephant 
was killed by two hired shooters, who were probably hired from outside the 
state. They came from a North-east state, forest officials suspect. The 
entire gang of the poachers has been identified.

Mr Jogesh Chandra Barman ordered to arrest the poachers and recover the 
tusks. He also said that probable involvement of any forest personnel would 
also be enquired. Following the minister's instruction a massive raid 
started in the Dooars area in North Bengal. Two inter-state smugglers of 
wildlife trophies have been arrested from Jaigaon area. The local people of 
Mendabari and Satali helped the forest personnel and police to arrest 
another one. A few others were also arrested later, during raids. During the 
interrogation, the arrested revealed that there were six in the gang, who 
were directly involved in the poaching. They confessed that they used 
poison-coated iron sticks to kill the tusker. It was suspected that the same 
gang has been involved in poaching elephants in the last few years in the 
region.

Poachers have struck once again and killed an elephant in the Lansdowne 
Forest Range of India's northern Uttaranchal state, officials said on 
Friday.

Forest guards discovered the body while on a routine patrol of the area.

Officials believe the poachers must have fled under the cover of darkness 
after leaving the pachyderm's dismembered body. The head and tusks had been 
removed.

The incident has created a flutter in the forest department.

""We have declared a red alert in the region,"" Ramesh Chandra, chief wildlife 
warden of Uttaranchal, said.

""All the staff has been mobilized and teams have begun combing the forests. 
We have contacted the forest officials of all districts bordering our range 
and their staff has been asked to coordinate with our staff. Local people 
also have been appealed to provide any information in the case,"" he added.

Chandra said they have intensified patrolling after several attempts of 
poaching came to light recently. This time the poachers walked away 
successfully.

Frequent poaching has led to a decrease in the number of elephants in India, 
which has more than 50 percent of the world's Asiatic elephant population.

There has been an increase in demand of the Asiatic tusker due to the sharp 
drop in elephant poaching in Africa.

A recent survey estimated that there were 25,000 to 28,000 elephants in 
India, including only 1,500 male tuskers of breeding age.

Although trafficking of wildlife products is banned in India, poaching of 
animals for their skin, bones and body parts, continues. Environmentalists 
say the Indian government is not doing enough to protect its wildlife. (ANI)",1

Guwahati, June 27 : Two people were trampled to death by wild elephants and 
a pachyderm was brutally speared to death by angry villagers in Assam, 
wildlife officials Monday said.

A wildlife warden said six elephants entered the Letukajan tea garden in 
Golaghat district, about 300 km east of the state's main city of Guwahati, 
on Sunday.

""The herd went on a rampage in the tea plantation before entering the colony 
housing garden workers,"" wildlife official D. Sharma said. The elephants 
tore apart mud-and-thatch huts and killed two people.

""A mother and her 18-month-old daughter were trampled to death by the 
elephants,"" Sharma said.

The herd left the garden after destroying at least a dozen huts and damaging 
tea crops.

In another incident in northern Assam's Udalguri district, villagers 
attacked and killed a seven-year-old male elephant that strayed from its 
herd and entered a tea plantation.

""It appears from the post mortem report that the elephant was first poisoned 
and then pierced with a hot iron rod,"" Kushal Konwar Sharma, a noted 
elephant expert and teacher at the College of Veterinary Science here, said. 
Sharma said the lone elephant was grazing in a paddy field close to a tea 
garden when villagers sprayed toxic chemicals in the area.

""The elephant must have been already affected by the chemicals and was in 
pain when some people pierced one of his forelegs with a hot iron rod that 
ultimately brought the animal down,"" Sharma said.

Elephant herds often stray out of their habitats for food and enter human 
settlement areas, resulting in such incidents. This has resulted in the 
death of 600 people and 275 elephants between 1990 and 2004.

In the past four years alone, villagers have killed 120 elephants - many of 
the animals being done to death with poisoned-tipped arrows or with food 
laced with toxic chemicals, an Assam government report says.

There are an estimated 5,500 wild elephants in Assam, out of India's total 
pachyderm population of 10,000.

""The man-elephant conflict has assumed frightening proportions,"" an official 
said.

Elephants in Assam are squeezed for living space and are stressed by 
development, thus growing increasingly violent.

Satellite imagery showed that as many as 45,850 hectares of thick forests 
were cleared by human encroachers between 1996 and 2000, leading to the 
breakup of traditional elephant corridors and their habitat.

""There has been fragmentation in the elephant habitat due to human 
settlements. We are trying to improve the situation by evicting illegal 
encroachers,"" Forest Minister Pradyut Bordoloi said.",1

Dharmajaygarh (Chhattisgarh): The Chhattisgarh Government has order an 
enquiry into the mysterious death of an elephant in the Dharmajaygarh forest 
on Friday.

The body of the elephant was found by the residents of the Krondha village 
on December two, who initially thought the elephant was alive, but when it 
did not move the whole day, they came to know that it was dead.

Bhoj Ram Rathiya, president of the Forest Protection Forum was the first to 
learn of it.

“When I came from duty, my son told that an elephant had died in the nearby 
area. It was too late in the night and I could do nothing but wait for 
daybreak. By 7 a.m. (local time) next day, I reached the committee's office 
and reported the incident,” said Rathiya.

The animal had a big wound on it's torso, with the major part of the head 
missing, and the tusk too was gone making it a prime case of poaching.

P K Kesar, the senior forest officer at the Dharmajaygarh reserve, however, 
said that the tusk has been retrieved.

“We tried looking around for clues that could explain the reasons of the 
elephant's death, like whether he had any bullet injuries etc. and the path 
he came from. We are also inspecting the condition of the site like signs of 
rampage and trampling, bloody trail and other details at a glance to help us 
to discover the possible run up to the death. But we drew a blank here and 
must depend on the post mortem for the final analysis. We have just learnt 
that the tusk that had been poached from it has been retrieved in the 
jungle,” said Kesar.

Indian Elephants are threatened by poaching for their tusks. The loss of 
habitat due to human pressure on forested areas is a major reason for the 
mammoth fall of population of elephants.

An elephant was electrocuted at Kanha National Park in Madhya Pradesh 
Tuesday, forest officials said.

The adult elephant, named Shivaji, had been trained by the forest department 
and died after coming into contact with overhead electrical wires, officials 
said.

and accidentally came in contact with a live wire.

Last week, a tiger was mauled to death by another tiger at Bandhavgarh 
National Park in Madhya Pradesh. A fortnight ago, a tiger was run over by a

BANDARLAMPUNG, Lampung: Illegal poaching claimed the lives of two elephants 
that were found shot and their tusks removed in Tanggamus regency in 
Lampung, just a few kilometers from the Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park.

""The carcasses were left to rot and their tusks taken,"" said Andoyo, an 
environmentalist in Tanggamus, on Friday. It is thought the elephants were 
shot last week.

He said the elephants were shot dead as could be seen from the bullet wounds 
in their skulls and legs.

The director of the Indonesian Forum for the Environment in Lampung, Mukri 
Friatna, said it was difficult to prevent elephant poaching as no action was 
ever taken against the culprits.

In 2003, four elephants were shot dead in Kuala Penet, near Way Kambas 
National Park. Eight other elephants were also found dead near the same park 
in July last year. Each elephant had been relieved of their tusks, which 
fetch Rp 5 million (US$500) per kilogram.",1

PALANI: Five wild elephants are standing shedding tears near the spot where 
an elephant electrocuted by a fence, was buried recently.

Wile elephants have been entering plantations on the fringe of jungles at 
the foothills of Western Ghats next to Palani. They have been damaging crops 
and posing a danger to human beings.

In order to prevent their entering his plantation, a farmer of Sattaparai 
had erected an electric fence. A female elephant, which came into contact 
with fence, was electrocuted.

Forest Department officials who arrived at the spot had a post-mortem 
conducted by veterinary surgeons. The dead elephant was buried at the same 
spot.

Five elephants, which had accompanied the female animal have refused to 
budge from the place and are standing there mourning the death of their 
female colleague.

In a fit of anger, they are also damaging the nearby plantations. Herds of 
other elephants are also arriving at the spot and shedding tears. People of 
this area are watching these elephants with awe and panic.",1

JAKARTA (AP): Six rare, wild elephants were found poisoned to death in an Sumatran jungle Wednesday, their mouths black and covered with potassium cyanide, a conservationist said.

Nurkalis Fadli from the World Wild Fund said he believed all the animals, who appeared to be from the same family, were intentionally killed.

The only male in the group had its tusks removed, he said.

""This is an extraordinary crime,"" Nurkalis told reporters in Riau province on Sumatra sland. ""Whoever did this must have known that Sumatran Elephants are extremely rare and protected by our laws.""

The animals, including one young elephant, were found close together near Mahato, a village 300 kilometers north of Riau's capital Pekanbaru.

Nurkalis said it appeared they had been dead for about a week.

Their habitat is quickly shrinking because of illegal logging and land clearing, and villagers often complain the animals venture into human settlements looking for food.

Pekanbaru is some 900 kilometers northwest of Jakarta.

COX'S BAZAR, Bangladesh, March 5 (Reuters) - A wild elephant died after it hit an electric fence illegally built by Bangladeshi farmers around their croplands, officials said on Sunday.

Other elephants of the herd later destroyed a house and many fruit-bearing trees in the area, in the country's southeastern jungles.

""The elephant was electrocuted as a herd came from the forest in search of food,"" senior forest official Oboni Kumar Tagore said.

Three elephants have been killed around the same forest in the last two months. Elephants have killed eight people, destroyed homes and crops during the same period.

Bangladesh, one of the world's most densely populated nations, has a forest cover of 17.5 percent.

Bangladesh has nearly 400 elephants, including 100 captive elephants. The number was 1,000 some two decades ago, forest officials said.

Jakarta , March . 12 (BNA) Indonesian environmentalists have demanded an investigation into the death of two more wild Sumatran elephants at a training centre in the eastern province of Riau, local media reports said today.
The wild elephants were killed for their tusks, said Nurcholis Fadlli, of the Worldwide Life for Nature (WWF) in the Riau capital of Pekanbaru. The state-run news agency Antara quoted Fadli as accusing an unnamed official at the elephant-training centre at Hutan Raya forestry park for the killings, after the beasts were captured in Siak district. Local government authorities in Riau have recently rounded up wild elephants following a series of rampages, destroying farmlands and injuring local residents.

Wild elephant electrocuted in Sivagiri forest range
P. Oppili, The Hindu
March 14, 2006

CHENNAI: A wild elephant was electrocuted in the Sivagiri forest range in Tirunelveli district when it came into contact with an illegal electric fence put up by farmers. Forest officials believe the incident happened last week.

Six persons, including three brothers who owned the farm, allegedly burnt the carcass after pouring petrol on it. They did not intimate the authorities. The remains were then sprayed in a nearby field, which was ploughed, the officials said.

They said the animal had strayed into a sugarcane field in Tirumalapuram village. The landowners had been illegally drawing power for the fence. On information, authorities visited the village and secured two labourers, V. Chinnadurai and K. Madasamy. The officials are on the lookout for the landowners as well as a tractor driver. The officials have recovered a portion of the burnt trunk, a tooth and viscera from the spot. An examination of the parts with the help of a veterinarian established that the carcass was burnt, they said.

M.G. Rao, Conservator of Forests, Tirunelveli, said a special team headed by Forest Range Officer of Sankarankoil, was formed to probe the incident.

To deter wild animals from straying into agriculture fields, the department put up a solar-powered fence with 12 volts of supply. This year the fence would be put up along the forest boundary, covering a distance of two km in the Sivagiri Range. The district administration also planned to put up a 10-km fence in the area, Mr. Rao said.

Last year, two elephants were electrocuted in the Tirunelveli Forests division, say officials. One of them was buried in the Devipatnam area by the landlord. In the other incident, the carcass was pushed into a well, they said.

DEHRA DUN: Uttaranchal forest officials are puzzled over the killing of an elephant after finding its body parts at a village adjoining the Rajaji National Park here and its tusks left buried.

The tusker was found with its body chopped into pieces and the tusks buried in the ground at Majri village near Rajaji Park in the district on Sunday, officials said on Monday.

They said forest guards found the carcass after the stench began wafting across the entire area.

Forest and wildlife officials were unable to place a finger on who might have killed the pachyderm even though three persons had been detained for questioning, they said patrolling in and around the Rajaji Park had been intensified and forest guards had launched a manhunt for the killers.

With the report of the killing of the tusker, patrolling in and around the Rajaji Park has been increased with forest guards launching a manhunt to track down the culprits.

Meanwhile, authorities at Corbett National Park are hunting for clues in the mystery killing of four tigresses in the area over the past two months.

Three were found dead inside the park while on January 19, another tigress was found dead at Bijrani area of the park and suspected to have been mauled by a tiger.

BHUBANESWAR: Wildlife officials were caught napping after poachers struck twice killing an elephant and a boar in Chandaka Wildlife Sanctuary near here on Saturday.

Both the incidents took place in the bordering areas of Haldia and Damapara forest ranges inside the sanctuary.

According to sources, a female elephant was hunted by poachers. Some forest officials were inspecting the spot when they heard gun shots. While tracking the sound, they came across two persons carrying the carcass of a boar.

However, the poachers managed to flee seeing the forest officials. Post-mortem reports said, the boar was shot twice from a country-made gun.

However, elephant's death was shrouded in mystery. While officials maintained that it could be a case of electrocution or poisoning by villagers trying to save their crops, some suggested that it could be killed for its teeth.

Female elephants don't have tusks unlike male ones, but have teeth.

Chief Wildlife Warden S.C. Mohanty said initial reports found that it could be a case of killing to stop the pachyderm from damaging crops.

However, poaching for the teeth cannot be ruled out, though the animal's teeth were not well developed.

He said the forest officials are combing the area and would soon nab the culprits. Strong action would be taken against the erring forest officials, he added.

""It is shocking as both the animals were killed under the Haldia range. We will take appropriate action against the erring officials,"" he said.

GRIK: A female elephant, believed to be between 15 and 16 years old, died of gunshot wounds in an oil palm plantation in Kampung Pulau Ceri, Lenggong yesterday.

The pachyderm was first captured in the area by Perak Wildlife and National Parks Department (Perhilitan) personnel on Sunday following reports of her presence by plantation workers.

Shortly after her capture, they noticed she was very weak and on closer inspection discovered two bullet wounds and pellet wounds in her forehead.

""We believe she was shot some time ago as the wounds were old and infected,"" a spokesman said. The bullet wounds were about 60cm deep.

Perhilitan staff tried their best to help the injured animal, but her condition worsened the following day and she died about 12.40pm.

""We had planned to have her transported to Belum forest once her condition improved,"" he said, adding that the seriously wounded animal had refused to eat.

""She was doing fine in the morning but when she keeled over around noon, we knew that nothing more could be done for her,"" the spokesman said.

Perhilitan staff, he said, tried to ease her last moments by pouring water on her head to cool her down and pacify her. The animal was buried in the evening where she died.

Department director Shabrina Mohd Shariff said the dead animal had a baby and was separated from a pack of four or five adult elephants.

""We have been monitoring their movement from Sungai Siput to Lenggong since April as we were planning to transport all of them to Belum.""

She said that the department believed the animal was shot by villagers or poachers.

PEKANBARU, Riau (Agencies): Four bodies of wild elephants have been found in the jungles of Riau province. Environmentalists suspected that the animals were dead after they were poisoned.

""Sample of the poison found near the dead elephant are being examined in laboratory,"" Samsuardi, an activist of WWF conservationist group was quoted by Antara news agency as saying.

One dead elephant was found at a forest near Segati village in Palalawan regency, while the three others were found at a timber estate owned by PT Siak Raya Timber.

Samsuardi estimated the animals were killed one month ago.

Meanwhile, Nurcholis Fadli also from WWF said that he believed villagers killed the elephants because they had been destroying crops, or because starving elephants had trampled at least four farmers to death last month.

He said he believed the dead elephants were from the same family in Tesso Nilo National Park, where several other elephants were found dead earlier this year.

Fadli said the elephants had been covered with tree branches while roads leading to their location were blocked by logs, Fadli said.

""There were strong indications that the animals were intentionally poisoned,"" Fadli was quoted by AP as saying in Pekanbaru. He urged authorities to take firm action to stop such killings.

He said at least 20 wild elephants have been killed this year. Sumatra's elephant habitats are quickly shrinking due to illegal logging and land clearing. About 2,500 are believed to live wildon Sumatra.

Coimbatore, Oct 6: A thirsty elephant looking for water drank fermented wash and died yesterday at Anaikatti forest area, about 45 km from here, along the Tamil Nadu-Kerala border, Forest department sources said today.

The pachyderm had strayed from its herd in search of water and run amok in Sholayar in Kerala a few days back. It had consumed the wash, containing ammonium sulphate and battery acid, from a reserve forest area in that state where illicit distillation activities were going on, the sources said.

After trampling a villager to death in another area, the elephant entered the Tamil Nadu forest area three days ago and after destroying banana and other crops, fell unconscious.

Though a team led by veterinary doctor N S Manoharan tried to revive the animal, it died in the early hours yesterday, the sources said.

The post-mortem revealed that the elephant had inflammation in the liver and intestinal haemorrhage.

Tamil Nadu forest officials have already alerted their Kerala counterparts about the illicit brewing activities going on in the reserve forest area, the sources added.

Fear of revenge by a herd of elephants has forced people in a Jharkhand village to flee from their homes following the death of a baby elephant after it fell into a well.

A baby elephant fell into a well in Banta village Saturday night, about 70 km from here after it got separated from the herd. The elephant finally succumbed to injuries Sunday morning despite a valiant rescue bid by the villagers and forest department officials.

The death of the elephant has terrified the villagers who are either deserting the village or preparing to face the herd of angry, rampaging elephants.

â€˜It is better to move out to other places for the time being. The herd will certainly attack the village,â€™ said Ramgopal Mahto, a resident of Banta.

Echoed Shyamal Mahto, a fellow villager: â€˜The herd has 13 members and they can destroy our village any time.â€™

The forest department is also taking precautionary measures to keep the tuskers away from the village.

â€˜A group of 20 people will be constituted to drive away the tuskers into the forest areas,â€™ said Krishna Kumar, a forest official. â€˜Firecrackers and kerosene oil will be distributed among the villagers to tame the tuskersâ€™.

In the last five years, more than 350 people were trampled to death by pachyderms in the state.

Wildlife experts said shrinking forest cover and encroachment upon elephant corridor has created this man-animal conflict.

Two elephants found dead (India)
Newindpress.com
October 13 2006

BHUBANESWAR: Two elephants were found dead in a paddy field in Lahanda under Keonjhar districtâ€™s Joda police limits on Thursday.

The pachyderms, both juvenile females, are believed to have been poisoned.

There was no sign of any external injury nor was there any electricity supply line in the vicinity to suggest that the two could have been electrocuted, sources in the department said.

The place where the carcasses of the two elephants were found was only a kilometre from Lahanda under Champua Forest Range. Forest officials have rushed to the spot to take stock of the situation. It was yet to be ascertained if the elephants were killed for their tush.

Only four days back, an adult elephant was found killed in Similipal Tiger Reserve. Three forest officials had been placed under suspension over it.

In the past few years, North Orissa, Keonjhar to be particular, has proved to be vulnerable for the elephants. Interestingly, it is Keonjhar through which the elephants have a migrating corridor to Jharkhand and West Bengal.

The Keonjhar Division has over 100 elephants but retaliatory killing rather than poaching has become an issue of concern. The two most practised form of retaliatory killing are electrocution and poisoning.

During the span ranging from 1990-91 to 2003-04, as many as 188 elephants have been poached in Orissa while another 100 have died in accidents.

Three wild elephants electrocuted in Assam (India)
By IANS
November 13, 2006

Guwahati, Nov 13 (IANS) Three Asiatic wild elephants have died of electrocution after a high tension wire fell on a herd in Assam, wildlife officials said Monday.

A forest warden said an elephant herd Sunday strayed into the Behali tea plantation, about 230 km from here, and tripped over an electric pole.

'The high tension wire first electrocuted a full-grown female elephant and immediately two of her calves tried to rescue her and in the process all the three died,' Chandan Bora, divisional forest officer, told IANS by telephone.

The herd of about 35 elephants was moving in the area for quite sometime causing large-scale depredation to paddy fields and damaging village huts.

'It was a touching sight when the rest of the herd surrounded the dead elephants and were literally in tears, trumpeting at times and licking them frequently,' the warden said.

The herd retreated from the accident site after sundown Sunday.

'We have ordered an investigation to probe if the electric wire fell on the elephant herd after the animals tripped on the pole or was it an intentional ploy by villagers to take revenge as the herd had damaged their properties,' Bora said.

Deadly turf wars between humans and hungry elephants in Assam have reached alarming proportions.

Shrinking forests and encroachment on elephant territory by people have forced the animals to stray from their habitats into human settlements in the quest of food.

Elephants have killed nearly 240 people in Assam in the past five years while 265 elephants have died during the same period, many of them victims of retaliation by angry humans, said a wildlife department report released last month.

Satellite imagery shows that between 1996 and 2000, villagers encroached on some 280,000 hectares of thick forests in Assam, according to authorities.

The attitude of people towards elephants has become less tolerant as the pachyderms have become an increasing problem for villagers. Villagers often poison the marauding elephants, while in the past they drove them away by beating drums or bursting firecrackers, said officials.

Assam has India's largest population of Asiatic elephants, estimated at around 5,300, according to a wildlife census in 2002.

Rogue elephant 'Laden' killed in Assam
Daily News and Analysis
December 16, 2006  

GUWAHATI: Laden, a rogue wild Asiatic elephant that was wreaking havoc in Assam, was on Saturday shot dead on state orders.

A wildlife official said the 10-feet tall male tusk-less elephant was killed by a hunter at the Behali tea plantation in Sonitpur district, 240 km north of Guwahati.

""Licensed hunter Dipen Ram Phukan and a team of forest rangers shot dead Laden as the elephant was moving around aimlessly and trying to enter a human settlement area,"" wildlife warden Chandan Bora said.

""Local villagers identified the elephant as Laden and our team verified the identity before shooting,"" he added.

The elephant, named Laden by locals after global terrorist Osama bin Laden, was proclaimed a rogue in July and authorities ordered that the pachyderm be killed by Dec 31. 

""Laden was responsible for killing at least 14 people in and around the area where he was shot dead after a massive hunt,"" Bora said. On Wednesday, the elephant had killed a woman near a reserved forest area.

""Laden was a terror for the people. Two earlier attempts to kill the elephant had failed as Laden always managed to evade our forest teams,"" he added. ""The killing of the rampaging elephant has come as a big relief for the locals.""

In Assam, depredation by wild elephants is common. The last time an elephant was declared a rogue and killed by a licensed hunter was in 2004. During the past fortnight, herds of wild elephants have been terrorising several parts of Assam, especially in villages where tribals brew rice beer.

Experts say wild elephants have been moving out of the jungles in search of food with more and more people encroaching upon animal corridors, leading to an increasing number of elephant attacks on villages.

Elephants have killed 248 people in Assam in the past five years while 268 elephants have died during the same period, many of who were victims of retaliation by angry humans, said a wildlife department report released last month.

Villagers often poisoned marauding elephants or drove them away by beating drums or bursting firecrackers.

Assam has India's largest population of Asiatic elephants, estimated at 5,300, according to a wildlife census in 2002.

March 14, 2007

FOUR wild elephants drunk on beer were electrocuted when they stumbled into a power pole and brought it down on top of themselves in northeast India.

Elephants are known to have a taste for the rice beer brewed by tribes across northeast India.

A herd of up to 25 elephants rampaged in a remote area in the West Garo Hills district earlier this week, forcing villagers to run for cover and leave their freshly brewed beverage behind, BBC News online reported.

After drinking the village dry, the elephants ran into a power pole, bringing it down.

Their trunks bore the brunt of the shock from the high-tension wire and four elephants were killed instantly, the website said.

Elephant expert Kushal Konwar Sharma, an Assam  lecturer, said elephants frequently drank rice beer and caused devastation when they became intoxicated.

Wildlife officials said that in the last two years elephants had killed at least 180 people in Assam and Meghalaya, and more than 200 elephants had been killed by angry villagers in the last six years.

Siliguri, July 11: A bullet ridden cow elephant was found dead in Nepal's Bamondangi region bordering West Bengal's Naxalbari block in Darjeeling district today.

Eastern Nepal's Jhapa district veterinary S Sapkota while denying an earlier report saying the Royal Nepal Police shot dead the pachyderm, said the task and nails from carcass were removed. He said possibly the poachers were behind the killing of the female adult elephant for its task and nails. Three bullets were found from carcass, Mr Sapkota said confirming a post-mortem report.

Earlier a report said RNP shot at a group of 50 pachyderms to divert their route, which was later denied.

Meanwhile, forest department at Mahananda sanctuary in Kurseong division was alerted following a report that two wounded pachyderms entered after crossing the common Mechi river in Naxalbari region.

West Bengal Forest Minister Ananta Roy told UNI that a female elephant was killed and a cub injured.

He said efforts were on to confirm details of the elephant casualties.

Himalayan Nature and Adventure Foundation secretary Animesh Basu said similar incident had happened in 2003 and a meeting between India's and Nepal wildlife officials held to ensure such thing did not recur. But there was no follow up and the latest casualty was a result of such lapses.

He said the wild elephants have huge trails from Asom to Nepal via Bhutan and Chapramari and Mahananda in West Bengal. But a vast area was encroached by the people on both sides of India and Nepal making the jumbo quite vulnerable to the poachers.

A herd of Elephant from India crossed the Mechi River and entered the cornfields of Debiganj of Nepal on Tuesday morning of July 6 and were greeted by swarms of bullets that killed a full-grown female Elephant, and injured at least six of them including a calf, a source from forest dept said. Though the herd fled back to the forest of Kalabari in North Bengal, there were no traces of them till Thursday morning as the search continued with the help of Kunki elephants. The state Govt of West Bengal has sent a note to the Foreign Affairs Dept in the capital.
 
The forest dept of West Bengal has been able to gather a video footage on   the elephant massacre shot through a mobile phone by a villager, which clearly shows how the female Elephant died on the spot and even after getting bullet shots on her trunk and legs, another mother Elephant tried to save her calf. The officer of Sukna range said that the video footage was handed over to the higher authority and with the help of the footage, they are searching the wounded and the herd.

The Forest Minister described the incident as a very strange and rare case as the border area is guarded by the Nepal police and the army. He expressed his concern that in spite of the fact that the army and Nepal police are guarding the area, it's daring for a group of people to do such a notorious thing. The matter has also been reported to the Chief Minister. The PCCF of West Bengal confirmed the death of one Elephant and said that since the issue is an international one, the Central Govt. has been requested to take up the matter with the Nepal Govt. 

The forest dept reports that on Tuesday afternoon the herd entered Debiganj of Bamundanga, Nepal after crossing Mechi River, 35 km away from Nakshalbari in West Bengal. When 8 or 9 of them proceeded towards the cornfield the hordes of bullets came down. The villagers informed that the molar teeth, part of trunk, tail and nails were chopped off from the carcass. The incident also baffled the staff members of the Nepal forest & animal welfare dept, who admitted that the area is a regular corridor for the Elephants.
The forest minister hinted the fact which was endorsed by the villagers of Bamundanga that this massacre was done by none other than the Nepal border security force. Every year in this season the Elephants cross the border and enter the cornfields. This year too this particular group of around 59 Elephants were moving around the Mechi river and the Nepali villagers were driving them away almost regularly with poison arrows and stones. Few years back these same villagers had brutally stoned an Elephant calf to death in front of its mother and after that incident the mother became rogue and trampled 13 persons in Nakshalbari. Finally she had to be shot dead by the West Bengal forest dept.
People of Debiganj and Kalabari added that they heard excruciating sounds of the Elephants after the gun-shots.

NEWSPost India
July 20, 2007

An elephant calf chased by villagers died after its legs got stuck in the mud in a West Bengal village.

A group of villagers was chasing a herd of elephants with crackers and bamboo sticks Wednesday night when the incident occurred at Birpara in Dooars, about 700 km from here.

The calf, hardly one-and-a-half years old, could not flee and fell in the mud. The herd struggled throughout the night to pull it up from the ground, but with no success, officials said.

'We saw the jumbos trying to pull up the injured calf from the ground, but they failed again and again. Early on Thursday, when the elephants realised that the calf had died, they gradually trudged away,' said Birpur Mangal Munda, a local villager.

The divisional forest officer (DFO) of Jalpaiguri forest range Kalyan Das said the calf had died of cardiac failure.

'The young elephant could not bear the exhaustion as it was suffering from heart blockage. The body has been sent for post-mortem examination to confirm the exact nature of the death,' Das said.

'The calf had probably died of exhaustion and sudden shock,' Animesh Basu, member of the Siliguri-based Himalayan Nature and Adventure Foundation, told IANS.

Meanwhile, a baby elephant which was rejected by its herd, apparently because its smelled of humans, was accepted by a captive female elephant at Jaldapara Wildlife Sanctuary.

The calf, hardly 15-days old, had been rescued by villagers Wednesday near Marianbari Tea Estate in Darjeeling district, about 650 km north of Kolkata, and treated by forest department officials at the Sukna rescue centre.

Aug. 31: West Bengal state forest workers transport a dead elephant on a crane, as villagers look on at the Sylee tea garden in eastern India.

An elephant was electrocuted Wednesday in a north Bengal tea garden after it touched a live wire with its trunk, forest officials told the Indo-Asian News Service.

A herd of 15 to 20 elephants wandered into the tea garden at Jalpaiguri's Malbazar, about 370 miles from Kolkata, looking for food, when one that strayed from the herd felt a live wire with its trunk and died instantly, reported the news service.

The elephant's body will be examined to confirm the cause of death, officials told the news service.

About a week ago, an elephant's body was found in the same forest after it had been killed by poachers, reported the IANS.

Three days later, a 4-year-old elephant calf was knocked down by a train in the Gulma Forest Range. In the last two years, eleven elephants have been killed by trains in north Bengal.

According to the IANS, elephants usually take the forest corridor from Mechi in Nepal to Sankosh in Assam, but on the way they often stray into villages and tea gardens in search of food.

Rampaging elephants kill 8 in India
Associated Press
July 26, 2007

GAUHATI, India (AP) â€” Two domesticated elephants went on a rampage through several villages in northeastern India, killing eight people and wounding five before being shot dead by police, officials said Thursday.

Police were searching for the owners of the elephants and trying to establish what caused the violent behavior, rare among tamed elephants. Angry villagers protesting the lack of protection burnt down the local forestry office.

The rampage occurred Wednesday in an area bordering India's Assam and Mizoram states, said Gautam Ganguly, a senior government official in the area.

The two elephants, a male and a female, ran through at least five villages in Assam, trampling anyone who got in their way before crossing into the neighboring state of Mizoram, where police were called in.

""Men of the Mizoram Police finally gunned the elephants down after dusk,"" Ganguly said.

Local government officials said the families of the dead would receive $1,250 in compensation.

The remote region is home to some 5,000 wild Asiatic elephants, and conflicts between the elephants and humans have been on the rise due to constant encroachment on the animals' habitat. However, attacks by domesticated elephants are extremely rare.

Train Runs Over Elephant Calf In North Bengal (India)
NEWSPost India
July 26, 2007

A four-year-old elephant calf died after being run over by a train in Darjeeling district of West Bengal, forest officials said Thursday.

A dead elephant calf was found Wednesday evening near railway tracks in Gulma Forest Range, about 530 km from Kolkata, with injury marks on its body.

An inquiry revealed that the Guwahati-Jhajha Express had passed the spot a little while before the carcass was discovered.

Forest officials said the elephant was a member of a herd that had been attacked by poachers in Nepal a few days ago. This is the third member of the herd to have been killed in the last few days.

On July 22, an elephant's body was found inside the Gulma Forest Range with multiple injury marks caused by poisoned arrows or sharp weapons.

About 11 elephants have been killed in the last two years on the tracks connecting New Alipurduar and New Jalpaiguri. A few days ago, a tiger was run over by a train on the same railway track.

Forest officials have alleged that trains do not abide by the speed restriction while passing through the forest. However, railway officials said speed regulations are imposed and followed by the drivers.

KEONJHAR, Aug 19: Poachers have become effective with the cancellation of the Baitarani Elephant Reserve Project. A tusker was killed in Banamahuladiha forest in Patna and the tusks were taken. The forest department came to know about the incident on 17 August while the carcass indicated that the crime was committed a week ago. While the forest department could not investigate the matter due to incessant rain the villagers said that there is sufficient proof to establish that it is a handiwork of the poachers. Mr Binaya Bhushan Patnaik, an elephant lover, said that the withdrawal of the Baitarani Elephant Reserve Project has endangered the lives of the pachyderm.
Mines are destroying acres of forest by going beyond their actual area. As pachyderm are herbivores, they are not getting sufficient food. The elephant corridors have been blocked. This is the reason as to why they are entering human habitations. And in turn, the poachers are taking advantages of it. Without the Elephant Reserve Project, the Keonjhar district will become devoid of elephants.
Hundreds of people have fallen prey to elephant attacks in the past 10 years, out of which 74 have died since 2001-02. On the other hand 47 elephants have died since 2001-02. According to the 1995 census, there were 59 elephants in Keonjhar, and 145 in the proposed project area. It can be noted here that the Baitarani Elephant Reserve Project was to come up in an area of 10,560 sq km.

KEONJHAR, Sept. 19: A speeding goods train hit two female elephants, killing them on the spot and injuring a calf. The incident happened when the herd was crossing the track at Bansapani near Joda yesterday. Sources said that a herd of elephants were crossing the railway line at Bansapani under the Joda police station limit, when a goods train coming from Jurudi hit the herd.
While two elephants died on the spot, the calf was injured. The rest entered the nearby forests.
 The DFO Mr Pradeep Karat who visited the spot today said: â€œIt was the first mishap of this nature in the district.As the railway facility is relatively new in the area and the entire track passes through forests, the forest personnel have to take extra precautions to protect wild animals.
The forest department sources said that the injured calf would be soon shifted to the Nandankanan zoo at Bhubaneswar.
 Regarding the withdrawal of the Baitarani Elephant Reserve Forest, Mr Karat said that â€œthe withdrawal of the project does not affect the number of elephants in the district.â€
In Joda and Barbil areas, continuous mining activities, like blasting, is disturbing the wild animals of the locality.
Due to rapid industrialisation, some of the natural water sources have already dried up and some are on the verge of doing so.  As such the elephants are entering the human habitations and facing trouble.
 Forty-nine elephants have died for various reasons since 2001-02 in the district.
On 17 August, a tusker was killed in the Banamahuladiha jungle in Patna under the Ghatagaon range.  According to the 1995 census, there were 59 elephants in Keonjhar, and 145 in the proposed Baitarni Reserve project area.

GAUHATI, India (AP) â€” Six Asiatic wild elephants were electrocuted as they went berserk after drinking rice beer in India's remote northeast, a wildlife official said Tuesday.

Nearly 40 elephants came to a village on Friday looking for food. Some found beer, which farmers ferment and keep in plastic and tin drums in their huts, said Sunil Kumar, a state wildlife official.

They got drunk, uprooted a utility pole carrying power lines and were electrocuted in Chandan Nukat, a village nearly 150 miles west of Shillong, the capital of Meghalaya state, Kumar said.

""There would have been more casualties had the villagers not chased them away,"" said Dipu Mark, a local conservationist.

The elephants are known to have a taste for rice beer brewed by tribal communities in India's northeast. Four wild elephants died in similar circumstances in the region three years ago.

India's northeast accounts for the world's largest concentration of wild Asiatic elephants with the states of Assam and Meghalaya alone estimated to have 7,000 of them.

""It's great to have such a huge number of elephants, but the increasing man-elephant conflict following the shrinkage in their habitat due to the growing human population is giving us nightmares,"" said Pradyut Bordoloi, former Assam Forest and Environment Minister.

COOCH BEHAR, Jan. 11: Bangladesh Rifles jawans gunned down an Indian elephant which had stormed into Bangladesh early this morning and had killed one person, injured another and destroyed about 25 hutments at Burimari in Lalmonirhat district, Bangladesh.
According to the Cooch Behar district magistrate, Mr Rajesh Sinha, the decision to shoot down the elephant was taken after all efforts to control it and bring it back to India failed.
The wild elephant apparently had wandered out of forest in Jalpaiguri. Apprehending that the BDR jawans could kill the tusker, the Cooch Behar DM had contacted his counterpart in Lalmonirhat, Md Rafiqul Islam, over phone and had requested the latter to save the animal.
Senior forest officials, including the chief conservator of forests, Mr S Patel, Cooch Behar DFO, Mr Apurba Sen, and Jalpaiguri DFO, Mr Tapas Das, also went to the border near Mekhliganj along with two tame elephants from Jaldapara, a crane and a truck. Trained forest personnel of the elephant squad from Gorumara armed with guns and tranquilliser bullets too went to the border. But all arrangements went in vain in the end.
“The elephant broke open the gates of the barbed wire fencing along the border under Doradabri border outpost adjacent to pillar number 849 in the early hours and crossed over to Burimari,” the Cooch Behar DM, said. ",1

Later, hundreds of villagers blocked the Kolkata-Raipur national highway near the sanctuary to demand action against electricity department officials who, they claimed, had failed to check the low-hanging high-voltage power line that caused the deaths.

“As per rules, the power lines in these areas should be 4.6 metres above the ground. However, in this case, they were just two metres above,” Badrama forest officer Saroj Kumar Panda told IANS.

“At least five elephants had come out of the sanctuary at 10 p.m. Wednesday. The elephants were returning to the sanctuary after drinking water from a pond,” Panda said.

“Three elephants returned safely but two got electrocuted,” he added.

“There are clear guidelines by the central electricity authority which should be strictly enforced to prevent electrocution of elephants,” Biswajit Mohanty of the NGO Wildlife Society of Orissa told IANS.",1

Ramnagar (Uttarakhand), May 9 (ANI): A 15-year old elephant in Uttarakhand has got electrocuted after it dashed against a high-tension electric wire.
The forest officials said that they were informed about the electrocution of the elephant on Thursday.
” The elephant had come to drink water from this water hole. The height of this high tension wire is 2m 40 cms, so when it was passing, it dashed against the wire and got electrocuted,” said P.K. Patro, Divisional Forest Officer (DFO), Ramnagar.
The officials said that they had called upon the electricity department in the region earlier also to look into the matter and remove the wires that are lying low.
Villagers say even they had apprised the authorities that animals have been falling prey to these deadly wires and had urged them to take action.
They alleged that the apathy of the electricity department has resulted in yet another animal losing its life.
Experts say that wild elephants have been moving out of the jungles with people encroaching upon animal corridors, leading to clashes between elephants and villagers",1

Kolkata, June 22 The carcass of an adult elephant was found near the Indo-Nepal border on Sunday. The elephant had suffered bullet injuries in its head, which caused its death.

The state forest officials said the elephant was a member of the herd that had strayed into Bamundangi village in Nepal, close to the Indo-Nepal border from the Kalabari jungle of North Bengal.

It is alleged that either the Nepalese villagers or the police fired at the herd when the elephant entered the village. Sources said that other members of the herd might also have suffered injuries.

This isn't the first time that such an incident has taken place. On June 18, an elephant was electrocuted when it had strayed into the same village.

A similar incident was reported on June 16, after which the forest department had tracked down an elephant, which had suffered bullet injuries in its legs.

The wildlife experts said that this is not a new phenomena. In the last 30 years, elephant movements were reported in this stretch . â€œThe area from Tukriajhar Reserve Forests to Jhapa police station (in Nepal) have seen such movements in the past as they are an extension of the elephant habitat,â€ said Dhritikanata Lahiri Chaudhuri, wildlife expert.

In the past five years, as many as 10 elephants have been allegedly gunned down by Nepalese villagers or the Nepal Police. â€œWe have been engaging NGOs on both sides of the border to campaign in the border villages of Nepal against the killing of elephants,â€ said SS Bist, chief wildlife warden, state forest department. The matter has also been taken up by the state government at the Centre.

The forest department is now planning to undertake operations of chasing back elephants into the Mahananada Wildlife Sanctaury from which they stray out.

KEONJHAR: People of a town in Orissa's Keonjhar district executed a barbaric revenge on an elephant that had killed eight people over the last two years.

On Tuesday evening, when the elephant raided the area for fruits, a mob doused it with petrol and set it on fire. Its entire body in flames, the elephant ran wildly in all directions looking for water. But the mob beat drums and threw firecrackers to block its escape routes. Blinded with pain and disoriented, it would crash to its knees, struggle to its feet and run around again.

The elephant was on the verge of collapse when a downpour put out the flames. He was last seen on Wednesday, severely burnt but walking on NH-215. Forest officials said they have no information about the condition of the elephant.

""We have no information about this incident. I will definitely start an inquiry,"" assistant conservator of forests Bimalendu Acharya said.

Nagaon, June 21: Two elephants, a mother and its calf, died after they fell into a pond in the foothills of Kondoli, 35km from Nagaon, last night.

The incident took place when the pair was proceeding towards the hill in a herd comprising 40-45 animals.

The calf was the first to fall into the pond as soon as they had crossed Titajuri Basti.

The mother jumped into the pond to rescue the calf.

The villagers moved the Kothiatoli forest range office this morning to inform the authorities about the herd of elephants, which remained there till morning.

The villagers, oblivious to the incident that had taken place at night, feared an attack by the elephants.

The calf was one year old, while the mother’s age is yet to be ascertained.

The incident took place 1.5km from Kafitoli reserve forest.

There are 12 reserve forests in Nagaon, bordering Karbi Anglong.

Nagaon divisional forest officer Aftabuddin Ahmed confirmed the incident.

“Both of them were dead when our team reached the site,” he said.

There are two forest divisions in Nagaon district — Nagaon and Nagaon south.

Deforestation is rampant in some of these reserve forests, forcing the animals to stray into areas of human habitation.

Most of the villagers left the area as soon as the herd started to move.

“Initially, we had thought that they would start damaging the houses but the truth came out only in the morning when forest department personnel found the two dead elephants in the pond. The mother was found floating with her four legs up and the calf was at the bottom,” Manoj Dey, a villager, said.

“It is an unfortunate incident. Had it been reported to the forest authorities in time, something could have been done,” another villager said.

Villagers often see herds of elephants moving from one place to another, forcing them to temporarily flee from the site.

“The situation becomes scary at night when they suddenly start to attack and damage houses,” Raman Das said.

He recalled how in December 2006, a large number of elephants, numbering nearly 120, had suddenly invaded neighbouring Hojai.

The elephants roamed the streets of the town, while wildlife officials and police tried to disperse them by firing in the air, by bursting firecrackers and beating drums.

Thousands of residents of Hojai had to run for their lives. A few persons were injured and several bamboo houses were damaged in the ensuing chaos. The total population of elephants in Assam, according to the 2002 census, is 5,246.

In April, a 22-year-old elephant fell into a swampy pit in a remote area of Assam’s Dhansiri reserve forest from a height of about 30 feet and dislocated its hip joint.

While the experts considered mercy killing, the elephant succumbed to its injuries.

Last year, a speeding train hit an adult elephant and two calves close to the Rani-Garbhanga forest reserve on the outskirts of Guwahati.",1

SILIGURI, June 22: Yet another Indian wild elephant was killed in Nepal. This time, it's a 40-year old female pachyderm that has succumbed to bullet injuries allegedly inflicted by the Nepal police in the eastern district of Jhapa adjacent to the Siliguri sub-division.
According to Ms Sumita Ghatak, the divisional forest officer, Mahananda Wildlife Division - I in Siliguri, a herd of nearly 80 Indian elephants had strayed into Nepal from the Kalabari forests near Naxalbari in Siliguri last night but were brought back by the authorities in the neighbouring country.
""Early this morning, the locals discovered the dead body of an adult pachyderm at Bamundangi area on the Nepal side and informed us. The carcass bore several bullet injuries on its forehead and other parts of the body. We have informed the senior officials in state forest department about the incident,” Ms Ghatak said.
The spot, where the elephant carcass was found today, is located barely at a 100-metre distance from the Bamundangi police station in Nepal.
Local residents claim they had heard a massive gunfire last night and discovered the carcass today.
“Since, the Nepal Maoists have laid down the arms, it is the Nepal police and other security agencies there, who are shooting wild elephants,” alleged Mr Sujit Das of the Nature and Adventure Society, Oodlabari.
On 18 June, an Indian wild elephant calf was electrocuted at the Bamundangi area again, after coming in contact with a high-tension electric wire planted by villagers.
Expressing his worry over the killing of Indian pachyderms in Nepal, the state forest minister, Mr Ananta Roy today said that he would raise the matter with the chief minister soon and urge him to report the issue to the Union government.",1

Siliguri, July 19: Three elephants have been found dead in the Mahananda wildlife sanctuary near Siliguri in the past 24 hours.

There were no external injuries and foresters said they could have been poisoned by villagers wary of marauding herds.

A female aged about 35 and its two-year-old calf were found dead yesterday at the heart of the sanctuary. Forest guards on patrol spotted a four-year-old calf lying dead this morning, about a kilometre away.

â€œThere were no injury marks like those found when elephants die of electrocution or gunshots. After a preliminary probe, we suspect that the elephants died of poisoning but can confirm it only after receiving forensic reports from Calcutta,â€ said N.C. Bahuguna, the chief conservator of forests in north Bengal.

Vets who conducted the post-mortem said they felt the elephants had been poisoned.

Corn was found in the stomachs of the two animals found dead yesterday. â€œIt is possible that the they were poisoned by tea garden residents desperate to save their property,â€ said Bahuguna.

Elephants had last week entered Simulbari and New Chumta tea estates, bordering the sanctuary, and injured three garden residents and damaged six houses. In neighbouring Jalpaiguri, two men were killed and several injured.

Conservationist Animesh Bose said: â€œThe Mahananda fringe villagers might have put poison in foodgrain to prevent elephant intrusions.â€

Bose added that villagers had to be made aware of the loss that an elephant death brought. â€œThe forest department should also provide them with crackers and searchlights to thwart elephant raids.â€

PACHYDERMS IN North Bengal are being killed ruthlessly either by villagers or by the callousness of train drivers. A week ago three elephants were poisoned to death inside the Mahananda Wildlife Sanctuary in North Bengal. An elephant calf was run over by a train in the same sanctuary on Tuesday. The calf was run over in the Gulma range area of the sanctuary by the Guwahati-Jhaja Express. The calf was seven year-old.
 
The accident occurred in the wee hours of the morning. The poisoning and running over by a train apart, at least three elephants were shot dead by soldiers of the Nepalese Army last month when the pachyderms strayed into Nepal. Elephants are known to stray into the neighbouring country in search of food.

The conservator of forest (northern circle), wildlife, will inquire into the death, local media reported.  The Union Ministry of Environment is being kept informed. A running battle has been on between the Railway and Environment Ministry, given that this is not the first time an elephant has been run over by trains in North Bengal. The West Bengal Forest Department has been after the Railway Minister for a long time to caution train drivers on the stretch to travel slowly because the pachyderms quite often stray on to the tracks.
 
The issue is not new and has become a bone of contention.  A public interest litigation was filed in the Calcutta High Court.  On the basis of a court order a special inspection tam surveyed the area and the railways were asked to issue instructions to drivers to slow down when passing through this area. Though a parallel railway track bypasses the forest good trains are not directed along it.

The railways continue to treat elephant deaths on the track casually. According to the forest department on an average as many as four elephants are killed in the sanctuary area.

The railway lines wend their way through the Mahananda, Chapramari and Jaldapara sanctuaries and the Buxa Tiger Reserve in North Bengal known for its flora and fauna. In effect the railway tracks cut across what is known as the elephant corridor stretching from North Bengal and Sankosh in Assam to Mechi in Nepal.

SILIGURI, July 29: A wild elephant was found dead at the Fashkhoa tea estate under the Buxa Tiger Reserve (east) area in the Dooars this morning. The adult pachyderm is suspected to have died of poisoning and its viscera samples are now being forwarded to the animal research laboratory in Kolkata for confirmation.
According to Mr Kaushik Choudhury, ADFO, BTR (east), the carcass of the dead elephant was found at Fuelbari jungles of Fashkhoa tea estate that falls under the Hatipota range of the tiger reserve. It was the plantation workers who first spotted the dead pachyderm at around 9 a.m. and alerted the foresters. By the time forest officials arrived at the spot, condition of the carcass suggested that it died early today.
“There was no injury mark on the carcass. But we have found blood on the ground beneath the pachyderm's body that seem to be have come out of its right ear,” the ADFO Mr Choudhury said.
Adding further, the ADFO said that the it was not yet clear what has caused the death of the elephant and that they were waiting for the report of the postmortem performed towards this afternoon. “The pachyderm might have died of poison, or it could be a case of infighting among the herd of 10-12 elephants, to which the elephant belonged. We have collected viscera samples which would soon be sent to Kolkata for tests,” the forester said.
Pesticides sprayed on tea plantations can work as poison for the wild pachyderms. Besides that, the tea workers and forest villagers nurture a certain amount of hostility towards the wild elephants since they often attack human settlements.
With today's pachyderm death at the Buxa reserve, the number of wild elephants that died unnatural deaths in north Bengal in the last two months by way of electrocution, poisoning and train accident etc have shot up to ten.",1

CHENNAI: Forest officials found the body of a 20-year old tusker with bullet wounds near Kalithimbam forest range on Thursday. The poachers had sawn off the ivory bleeding the elephant to death.

In the past year, at least half a dozen tuskers have been poached in the forest of Sathyamangalam, Chamrajnagar and Kollegal divisions, home to two to three thousand elephants. And if the locals are to be believed, the number could be a dozen or more. TN Forest officials suspect the poachers to be from the Karnataka side. Last September, forest department officials arrested a gang from Kadaganalli across the border for poaching a tusker.

The TN and Karnataka Forest Departments, sensing the danger to wildlife in these three forest divisions — where there was no poaching for a decade after Veerappan turned to kidnapping — conducted joint meetings and camps a few months ago. “ After we started co-ordinating with each other, the forests were quiet for a few months,"" said a forest officer, expressing concern over the latest incident.

Veerappan, who is estimated to have killed 500 elephants, is dead and the STF, after his elimination two years ago, is content with training. The Erode Conservator of Forests has formed special teams to nab the poachers.

Forest officials say that a kilogram of ivory could fetch Rs 20,000 in domestic market but its value increases manifold in the international market. That two dozen more elephants have died of electrocution in the recent past is another story.",1

ROURKELA (Orissa): A wild elephant was electrocuted at Arjunda village in Kanika forest range of Sundergarh, 150 km from here, while a man was killed in tusker attack elsewhere in the district.
Police said in the first incident a pachyderm, aged 20-25 years, came in contact with a low-lying overhead 11 KV line while roaming outside the village on Sunday night.
On hearing its screams, villagers gathered but found that the tusker had already died.
Sundergarh Divisional Forest Officer (DFO) B N Thakur along with police visited the spot. The pachyderm was buried outside the village after a post-mortem.
The villagers had complained that such incidents were frequent due to low-lying high tension lines in rural areas.
In another incident, a 55-year-old man, Ray Gadia Munda was trampled to death by a wild elephant at Bambundia village under Sundergarh Sadar police limit, about 140 km from here on Monday night.
Police said while Munda died on the spot, his nephew escaped unhurt. Forest officials reached the village and promised financial assistance to the family.",1

RANCHI: Villagers poisoned a wild tusker to death in Khuti district of Jharkhand after it wreaked havoc on their standing crop and houses, said a forest official Sunday. 
""Primary investigations reveal that the wild elephant was poisoned Friday. We have taken the elephant's body in our possession,"" the forest department official said. According to him, ""the wild tusker had wreaked havoc in Torpa area of Khuti district."" 

The elephant was found dead Saturday in Torpa block, around 90 km from Ranchi. Primary investigations suggest the elephant was poisoned. 

""The food or water source seems to have been poisoned by the villagers to cause the death of the elephant,"" said the official. 

Four wild elephants died in Torpa block under mysterious circumstances in the last six years. 

The villagers offered flowers and prayed to the dead elephant in the belief it would minimise the wrath of the other wild elephants. 

Many villagers are upset over the death of the tusker. In India, the tusker is revered as a form of Hindu god Ganesha. 

Last year a wild elephant, named by villagers as Bin Laden, was poisoned in Ramgarh district of Jharkhand. 

Rampaging elephants regularly venture into villages, trample people to death and damage houses and standing crops. 

According to forest department figures, more than 600 people have been killed and more than 750 injured in the last eight years after being attacked by rampaging elephants.",1

because of their coming in contact with broken live electric wires lying in 
a field close to a minor irrigation project near the village.

The incident came to light when the farmers went at the site for work and 
found the tuskers dead.

BALASORE, Feb. 26: In a serious allegation against the forest officials, reportedly first of its kind, many villagers around Kuludhia forest range in Nilgiri under Balasore division said that the officials have killed an elephant for its tusks.
They later dumped the body near Sataghati near Chataka hills, the villagers charged while demanding a high-level probe. 
While the DFO could not be contacted despite several attempts, his sub-ordinate officials refuted the allegation and maintained that no such death in recent months have ever been reported.

Dibrugarh, Feb. 26: Poachers killed a pregnant elephant near Janokipathar, a small hamlet on the edge of Abhayapur reserve forest in Assam’s Sivasagar district last night. They chopped off and took with them the animal’s tail, tip of the trunk and right ear.
The gory sight of the elephant lying in a pool of blood with the rest of its trunk almost severed moved to tears even the villagers who have been enraged by the rampages of a herd of elephants in the area for the past few days. The female elephant was from the same herd.
Villagers said they heard two gunshots around 9 last night, but did not venture out in the dark.
“Moreover, we thought there could be militants around. But when we came out of our houses this morning, we saw this ghastly sight,” Lakhi Bhumij, who was the first to see the elephant carcass, said.
Lakhi was on her way to the forest in the morning when she saw the elephant lying in a pool of blood that had spilled out from a deep gash around its trunk and neck.
“For some moments I was numb with shock. Then I screamed and ran towards our house and woke up my husband (Narayan) and other villagers. It was a horrifying scene,” she said.
A villager said a herd, comprising about 30 to 35 elephants, had been inva- ding Janokipathar for the past three days in search of food.
“There has been no rain for a long period and gene-rally there is an acute shortage of fodder inside the forest during winter,” another villager said.
Many villagers of Janokipathar, which has 23 families, all from the ex-tea community, paid their last respects to the elephant.
It is suspected that poachers killed the elephant. Again, miscreants from Nagaland — the reserve forest shares a 20km-long boundary with the state — could have also killed the elephant for its meat. The killers, however, could not carry away much, although they apparently tried to as is evident from the wounds and the hacking of the entire trunk.
Sources said shortage of forest department personnel had encouraged poachers and timber smugglers to operate in the reserve forest.
The Abhayapur reserve forest, spread over 6737.98 hectares, has three camps at present — Lesai, Singlo and Kherbari, the last being 3km from Janokipathar.
Lesai is located inside the reserve forest while Singlo and Kherbari are located on the periphery.
A section of armed personnel from the Assam Forest Protection Force is posted at Kherbari.
Lesai has three unarmed forest personnel and one platoon of the Assam Police Battalion.
Singlo has just four unarmed forest staff.
The forest department has abolished two camps, Godapani and Joymati, which used to be located inside the reserve forest, because of shortage of manpower.
Sonari ranger Subodh Talukdar said over phone that a team of forest and police personnel and a magistrate had gone to the spot for investigation.
The reserve forest comes under the Sonari range.
“No bullet marks have been found on the animal till now. We are trying to find out whether the elephant was shot dead or poisoned,” he added.

PANAJI: Though all is quiet on Goa's border in the vicinity of Dodamarg, the peace has followed the tragic death of a female elephant after consuming some explosive-laden' trap recently. 

The elephant, a five year old female calf, was captured by Maharashtra forest officials on the other side of the border in a badly injured condition. ""It was unable to eat anything and was administered 400 salines and daily injections. It somehow survived three weeks and died late last month,"" Naresh Zarmuri, district forest officer, Maharashtra said. 

The post-mortem examination revealed severe injuries, including broken jaws with three cracks on the upper one and six cavities. ""When we caught the elephant, it had no teeth left,"" Zarmuri added. ""It is possible that it had eaten some fruit or eatable with an explosive concealed in it, meant for wild boar"" he said. 

The Maharashtra forest officials had trapped three elephants during the last few weeks with the help of a consultant from Assam and kunki elephants. One was released at Kendrem near Karnataka-Maharashtra border, another is being trained and one died of overdose. 

""Elephants are very sensitive and one can make a wrong calculation about the amount of tranquilisers sought to be injected into them from a distance. The quantity is calculated based on body weight. Only experts can guess the body weight and a slight overdose coupled with shock can prove fatal,"" a forest department official said. 

Meanwhile, the elephants which had kept forest officials and villages in border areas in both states on their toes have now moved towards Chandgad district of Maharashtra. ""There is no immediate threat of them entering Goa, but we are keeping track,"" a Goa official said. ",1

Jakarta - Suspected poachers killed two endangered elephants on 
Indonesia's Sumatra island, the state-run Antara news agency reported 
Friday.

The Sumatran elephants were found dead without their tusks Thursday 
in Riau province, Antara said.

Police were looking for the poachers who are believed to have used 
cyanide-laced pineapple to kill the animals, said Sahimin, an official 
at the local nature conservation agency.

'The killers of the elephants will be brought to justice,' he was 
quoted as saying by Antara.

In March, another two Sumatran elephants were killed in Sumatra's 
Bengkulu province.

Conservationists said widespread destruction of elephant habitat 
through illegal logging and uncontrolled conversion of forests into oil 
palm and pulp plantations has created conflict between humans and 
elephants, which are forced to feed on the crops that replaced their 
natural food resources.

Poaching has also been blamed for the dwindling Sumatran elephant 
population, the smallest among the Asian elephants.

The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), a global conservation group, 
estimates there are only about 3,000 Sumatran elephants left on Sumatra, 
the only island in Indonesia where they can still be found.

They are listed as an endangered species and protected by law.",2

KUALA LUMPUR: A female elephant, which was part of a small herd reported to be causing damage in several oil palm plantations, was found dead in Gerik last week. She was believed to have been poisoned.
The animal, almost an adult judging from the measurement of its front soles, succumbed to blood poisoning caused by ingestion of pesticide-laced food, said sources.
The carcass was discovered by wildlife rangers on May 18, at Kampung Strang, located next to a forest reserve that connects to the Belum-Temenggor forest complex.
A source alleged that the oil palm estate was an illegal operation by smallholders that encroached into state land.
He said there had been complaints of animal disturbance in the area by three elephants.
He added that the damage was not severe but ""yet, they resorted to poisoning the innocent elephants.""
Department of Wildlife and National Park (Perhilitan) deputy director-general Misliah Mohamed Bashir confirmed that a report had been received.
""We will act against the culprit but we must get the proof. Our people in Gerik are still investigating the matter,"" she said.
Elephants are protected species under the Wildlife Protection Act. Killing one without a licence is an offence that carries a fine not exceeding RM3,000 ($1,241.40) or imprisonment not exceeding three years or both, upon conviction.
To manage the human-wildlife conflict, more than 100 elephants had been relocated in the last 15 years.",1

JAKARTA (AFP) â€” Three dead elephants were suspected of being poisoned in the forest concession area of a pulp company in the Riau province of Indonesia's Sumatra island, a report said Tuesday.

One of the animal carcasses was found on June 1 and the others on May 28 in an industrial crop forest managed by PT Rimba Peranap Indah (RPI), a government official was quoted as saying by Antara state news agency.

""The company must be responsible for the safety of those elephants because the spot where they were found dead was still within their home range,"" Natural Resources Conservation Agency head Edy Susanto said.

The concession area used to be the elephants' natural habitat before it was converted into an oil palm plantation and acacia forest, he said.

Organ samples from the dead elephants had been sent to the veterinary test and research offices, the official added.

Two elephants found poisoned in Riau province early last month had also had their tusks removed but an official said the three dead animals found on RPI land were two females and a calf.

Sumatran elephants are the smallest Asian elephant and can live up to 70 years in captivity. They are listed as facing extinction by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species.

The injured pachyderm, which is an adult, is limping on its right leg, officials said. The foresters however, are yet to confirm that the wound was indeed a bullet-injury, which they are suspecting.
The injured pachyderm is part of a herd of 120 wild elephants whom the Nepal police shot at on the night of 9 June. The herd had strayed into Nepal at Kalabari area near Naxalbari thus inviting the cruel act on them.
Following the Nepal police firing, the herd returned to the Indian side of the forests and is now camping at the Panighata jungles.
“This evening, while monitoring the herd, we spotted an adult elephant which was limping on its right leg. We suspect it was injured in the Nepal police firing but an affirmation is still waited,” said the Panighata forest range officer Mr Bhupen Biswakarma.
Forest guards at Panighata are using searchlights from a distance to confirm the nature of the injury sustained by the elephant and are also looking for more injured pachyderms, if any.
“But a cent percent confirmation on the injury can be made only by tactfully isolating the injured from the parent herd and that's what the we are attempting now,” a forest official said.",1

JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) — An endangered Sumatran elephant found dead with its tusks removed in northwestern Indonesia may have been killed by poachers using poisoned pineapples, conservationists said Monday.
It was the ninth dead elephant found in that region of Sumatra island in three months.
The giant 30-year-old male probably was poisoned, said Syahimin, a government conservationist in Riau province who uses one name as is customary in Indonesia.
The latest body was discovered on a pulp plantation on Friday and pineapples were scattered on the ground nearby. A sample was sent to a laboratory where earlier tests have confirmed poisoning in the deaths of seven other elephants, four of them last month.
Police have said they are investigating all the incidents. No arrests have been made.
A World Wildlife Fund for Nature campaigner who saw the carcass, Syamsidar, said: ""Clearly, poachers are behind the elephant killings for money because the ivory has a high value on international markets.""
Indonesia's endangered elephants, tigers, rhinos and orangutans are threatened by shrinking jungle habitat, which is cut and burned to make way for plantations or sold as lumber. Only 3,000 Sumatran elephants are believed to still live in their natural surroundings.
The elephants increasingly venture into inhabited areas in search of food and sometimes destroy crops or attack humans, which upsets residents who lease land for commercial farming.",1

A she-elephant in an advanced stage of pregnancy has been shot dead by poachers at the Hurulu Environment park in close proximity to Kodigalakande Forest Hermitage at Habarana-Trincomalee main road.

Wildlife officials attached to Mahaweli Zone said that this 20 to 25 years old and 6 1/2 foot tall elephant would have probably been shot somewhere near June 5 or 6, a day before Poson Poya day.

Veterinary surgeon Dr. Suhada Jayasekera said that the death was due to haemorrage from gun shot wounds caused by a glakatas gun used by the poacher.

This she-elephant had the half finished grass in its mouth at the time of the death and it would have probably given birth to a baby-elephant in another two or three days, if not met with this tragic encounter, Dr. Suhada Jayasekera said.",1

VietNamNet Bridge – While local police hadn’t finished investigating the deaths of two wild elephants in the Vinh Cuu Nature Reserve in the southern province of Dong Nai, three more elephants were found dead in the reserve on July 8.
The body of a male elephant which was shot to death in Dak Lak province. 
The three elephant bodies were discovered in a forest in Dinh Quan district. The two smaller elephants were huddled against the stomach of the big elephant.
 
The elephants are said to have died by poisoning. Their position is around 6 km from the site where the two elephant bodies were detected previously, or the border area between Nam Cat Tien National Park and Vinh Cuu Nature Reserve.
 
According to forest rangers from the Nam Cat Tien National Park, the dead elephants are members of a herd of elephants that reportedly disturbed local people early this year.
 
Experts collected samples from the dead elephants for testing.
 
The Department of Agriculture and Rural Development of Dong Nai said that they have not been allocated with funds to design a project to preserve wild elephants in Dong Nai. ",1

Coimbatore, July 10 - ANI: An elephant that trespassed onto agricultural lands, was found dead at a village near Narasipuram in Coimbatore on Thursday.

According to villagers, the elephant was aged around 40 years and might have hit a high-tension (HT) electricity pole or come into contact with the wire.

The Narasipuram Forest Range office has been informed of the incident.

Forest warden Doraiswamy said the pachyderm was a victim of electrocution.

""We received a message that a male tusker had been found dead near the Poondi South beat area. On hearing the news, we went to the spot and found the tusker had died. This has been conveyed to the higher officials. Now, a veterinary doctor will examine and ascertain the cause of the death,"" said Doraiswamy.

Farmers of the area, however, called on the authorities to dig trenches and also fence the foothills to prevent elephants from entering.

""The best and only way to permanently keep these elephants at bay is to dig bunkers near the foothills and erect solar powered fencing,"" said Palaniswamy, a farmer.

Experts claim that massive deforestation, poaching and people encroaching upon forest corridors have forced elephants to move out in search of food and water.",1

A male elephant has been found dead at the Way Kambas National Park in Lampung with both its trunks missing, kompas.com reported Tuesday.

The park’s director, John Kenedie, said Tuesday the two-year-old elephant may have been poisoned. Park officials found him dead at his cage at about 2 a.m. on last Friday.

“The thieves might have fed him with food that was laced with rodenticide,” John said; adding that the thieves were probably familiar with the park.

The trunks weigh close to 70 kilograms and are valued at tens of millions of rupiah.

Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) activist M. Gio said trunk hunters are now targeting elephants bred in national parks due to the dwindling population of wild elephants.

The Way Kambas park covers 125,000 hectares of land and is home to 250 elephants.",1

Binnaguri (West Bengal), Aug 16: A rampaging adult female elephant was electrocuted at an Indian army camp at Binnaguri in West Bengal.

The elephant, which came from the Chapramari forest, first damaged a number of houses before getting entangled in a school's electrified fencing.

""The elephant came in the village in night. The elephant also attacked some houses of the village before entering the cantonment area. It received an electric shock and died there because of electrocution,"" said Dilip Toppo, a resident.

Wildlife officials are investigating the matter.

A team of veterinarians will conduct a post mortem to ascertain the exact cause of the death.

Home to 60 per cent of Asia's elephants, India has the highest death rate from human-elephant conflict, with 200-250 people and 100 elephants killed annually.

BANGALORE: How angry can you get at an animal? Though human-animal conflict is a regular event with more and more wild habitats being encroached, wrath like this is rare. A farmer near Bandipur reserve shot a young elephant dead when she was about to enter his farm on Wednesday.

Even while crop compensation packages have almost been tripled, fear and intolerance still persist among farmers who live on the border areas.

The female elephant was six years old and was grazing with three other elephants in a herd. According to Deputy Conservator of Forests of Bandipur Tiger Reserve, Raju, the elephant strayed in to the ragi farm, which is around 2 kms away from the forest. Mada Shetty, the farmer, allegedly shot the elephant on its forehead as soon as it was spotted near the farm.

One bullet hit his forehead while the other pierced through his eyelid. The animal collapsed on the spot. ""Since she was shot on the head, she succumbed immediately. We are not sure how the farmer got access to the revolver and what kind of a weapon it is. Once the body is opened, we can identify if these are muzzle loader bullet or not. But from the injuries, we are sure that she was shot,"" he said.

Farmers with weapons are supposed to get them registered with the forest department. ""It was just ragi and the elephant did not even destroy the crop. We don't understand why he reacted so violently. Shetty is absconding,"" he added.

Though the forest staff say that legal action will be taken and a team of police officials and a doctor are investigating the spot, they are quite shocked by the incident. Additional Principal Chief Conservator of Forests, BK Singh said ""It is definitely not common for framers to shoot down elephants or other animals. Either they dig a trench or use dry chillis. This behaviour is abnormal and disappointing. The crop compensation package has been increased so that we can limit the deaths of animals due to such conflicts. I don't understand why he shot the elephant so brutally,"" he said.

Currently, for every quintal of damaged Ragi the department is paying Rs 600. Human-elephant conflict is more common near the estates of Coorg but off late, it has been happening regularly in other forest areas as well. The farm where the elephant was shot is in Doddaburgi village and is not a very conflict prone area.

GUWAHATI: Battling for life for about a month with two bullet wounds in his head, a wild tusker succumbed to his injuries in Sonitpur district on Sunday afternoon.

The carcass was spotted in a paddy field adjacent to the Behali Reserve Forest, about 180 km from Guwahati. A senior forest official said the elephant was about 20 years old and 6.5 ft tall.

The official added that some members of a tribal group, called Daphala, had last month tried to kill the elephant and feast on it. Though the elephant was hit by a bullet, the pachyderm managed to survive.

Members of an NGO, Natures Bonyacran, had first spotted the injured elephant on August 15, but they could not tranquilize the animal because they did not have a pachyderm with them to catch the wounded animal. ""The animal eventually lost its way in the forest,"" coordinator of the NGO Ajoy Sarma said.

Natures Bonyacran members had been searching for the injured elephant since then and he was spotted again on Saturday. ""He came out of the jungle on Sunday in search of food and went straight towards paddy fields,"" Sarma said.

After informing the doctor of Centre for Wildlife Rehabilitation Centre. the NGO workers had been keeping a close watch on the jumbo since the morning. Sarma said, ""It died around 1.30pm and the doctor arrived after half an hour since then. We found two bullet injuries in the head of the elephant's carcass. One of the marks was fresh. Incidentally, we heard sounds of gunshots on Sunday morning,"" he added.

GUWAHATI: Poachers have gunned down an elephant and chopped off its tusks and trunk in Assam's Karbi Anglong district on the southern banks of the Brahmaputra near the Kaziranga National Park. 

Forest officials found the carcass of the jumbo, with the mark of a bullet wound on its head, on Saturday. According to sources, the elephant might have been killed about ""two days ago"". A machete, belonging to a particular tribal group, was found in the area that lies between Panbari Reserve Forest near Kaziranga and Dalamara forest range in Karbi Anglong. Incidentally, elephants often use Panbari as a corridor to move between Kaziranga and Karbi Anglong. 

""The injury marks showed that a rifle was used to kill the jumbo. And, in all probability, the poachers used the machete to cut off its trunk. They have killed the elephant in a gruesome manner,"" said Garga Mohan Das, project officer of WWF-India's Kaziranga-Karbi Anglong Landscape Conservation Programme. 

""This is very very worrying. We fear that the gang of poachers, who killed the elephant, might also target jumbos in Panbari and its adjoining areas,"" he added. 

Honourary wildlife warden (Golaghat) Arup Goswami said it would be very difficult to save the elephants, rhinos and tigers in the area if the government does not construct a foolproof security network. 

""Most of the animals are killed in transit between Kaziranga and Karbi Anglong.We aren't worried about the security of animals living in the protected areas like Kaziranga. Our concern is what happens to them once they go out of such areas. In fact, the poachers lie in wait for animals moving out of Kaziranga,"" he added. 

Though elephants are frequently injured during conflicts with human beings in Golaghat and adjoining Karbi Anglong, forest officials said poaching of jumbos is a rare incidence. The last time an elephant was killed by poachers in the Kaziranga-Karbi Anglong landscape was around two years ago. 

In fact, Golaghat and the adjoining areas of Karbi Anglong have emerged as one of the most intense man-elephant conflict zones. People often use firearms to chase away herds of wild pachyderms, increasing the risk of them succumbing to bullet wounds. 

Till recent years, elephants used to pass through the Panbari Reserve Forest in Golaghat to Karbi Anglong and Nagaland without any disturbance. But the situation is no more the same. The entire route, which traditionally covered areas like Panjir Pahar, Kakokchang, Deothar, and up to Nambor-Garampani and Lengrapahar, is in a shambles owing to endless encroachment and relentless deforestation. 

In last five years, the Panbari Reserve Forest has seen stone excavation and tree-felling at a hectic pace.",1

Assistant conservator of forest (Keonjhar) Trilochan Mohanty said, ""The full-grown tusker was killed when it came in contact with 11 KV line. It was supposed to be at 13 feet but was hanging at 10 ft."" There were burns on the trunk, left leg and near the left tusk. 

The lone tusker was moving in those area since the past few days in search of food. The local villagers gathered near the dead tusker and worshipped it. The electricity cables drawn in these areas are very old. 

Hence, most of the lines hang at lower levels. There had been several instances of elephants dying of electrocution. Two were killed in Lahanda-Mutuda village in the said forest range. ",1

GUWAHATI: An elephant was electrocuted near a tea garden in the Kathiatoli area of Nagaon district, about 140 km from here, on Saturday. 

The carcass of the pachyderm was found near Kandoli tea estate. Forest officials said it was an accident and not a case of retaliatory killing. ""The elephant died after its trunk touched a livewire near the tea estate. It was not killed by human beings,"" Nagaon divisional forest officer A Ahmed said. ""There has been an increase in the movement of elephants between Karbi Anglong and Nagaon since the past few days. But there has been no untoward incident,"" he added. 

The Burapahar forest range of Kaziranga National Park is in Nagaon district. On the south, it is bordered by the hilly and forested Karbi Anglong district. The man-elephant conflict has been on the rise in Nagaon. But the situation has not yet become as alarming as it is in Sonitpur, Golaghat and Udalguri. In Nagaon, most of the cases of man-animal conflict are reported from the Chapanala and Salna areas. 

Shimanta Goswami, president of local NGO Green Guard said, ""Elephants from Karbi Anglong come down to Chapanala, Salna and its adjoining areas almost everyday. Though there has been no man-elephant conflict in the recent past, herds of wild jumbos have damaged many houses and crops."" He added, ""Elephants are increasingly straying into human settlements as they don't find enough food in the forests after scanty rainfall. Though jumbos from Karbi Anglong often come down to Nagaon, the cases of man-elephant conflict has been lesser this time."" 

Statistics reveal Sonitpur recorded the highest human casualties with eight deaths till May 24 this year, while Dhubri comes second with five, followed by Udalguri (3). Two persons had been killed by wild elephants in the Chirang wildlife division in the same period. On the other hand, the Sivasagar Wildlife Division, Jorhat Wildlife Division, North Lakhimpur Wildlife Division, Dhemaji Wildlife Division and Goalpara Wildlife Division had recorded one human death each till May 24 this year.

CHAMARAJNAGAR: A 25-year-old female elephant was found dead at a farm owned by Rangya Nayaka of Kotkere village under Omkar forest range in Gundlupet taluk.

Sources said that the animal had died in 'mysterious circumstances'.

A post-mortem was conducted.

Meanwhile, villagers in the area staged a protest against the increased movement of wildlife and subsequent crop loss in villages near the forest.

They alleged that forest officials— who refuse to assess reports of crop loss— turn up only to look into the death of wild animals; and harass innocent villagers by accusing them of killing animals.

The protestors further alleged that the department had not compensated the farmers who had lost their crop due to the growing menace created by the elephants.

Guwahati, Oct. 23: The carcass of a full-grown female elephant, suspected to have died of poisoning, was found this morning at Orangajuli tea estate along the Indo-Bhutan border in Udalguri district.
This is the sixth elephant to have fallen prey to the rising cases of man-elephant conflict along the border the district shares with Bhutan. Eleven persons have been killed by elephants since last November.
The divisional forest officer, Udalguri, Bankim Sharma, said over phone that preliminary investigations suggested that the elephant had died of poisoning. The exact cause of death will be known only after post-mortem.
“The viscera will be sent to the state forensic laboratory for ascertaining the exact cause of the death,” Sharma said.
Sharma said though the labourers of Orangajuli claimed that the elephant had died of injuries sustained during infighting among members of a herd last night, the carcass bore no injury mark.
Another forest official said there was regular conflict among tea garden labourers and elephants as the animals constantly strayed into human settlements in search of food.
“The scent of country liquor also attracts elephants towards human settlements,” the official said.
Labourers often lace bananas and banana trees with toxic chemicals, mainly fertilisers used in the tea bushes, and place these on the routes constantly used by the elephants, forest officials claimed.
Elephants love to gorge on bananas.
Sharma said in view of the increasing man-elephant conflict, the forest department had taken several steps to minimise casualty.
“We have formed teams, including members of the administration, NGOs, local villagers and the forest department to prevent such conflicts through monitoring.”
Last month, the forest department also set up a permanent forest camp at Hatigarh tea estate in Udalguri district, not very far from today’s incident site, to chase away elephants from human settlements.
Sharma said the forest department had also been conducting awareness programmes to motivate local people to inform the forest department immediately, instead of attacking the pachyderms.
“Depleting forest cover has forced the elephants to stray into human habitats regularly. The only option left is to motivate the people to live and let live,” Sharma said.
According to a study, of the 41,000 square km of elephant habitat in the Northeast, less than 6,000 square km falls under the protected area network resulting in an increase in human-elephant conflicts. Assam has a population of about 5,000 wild elephants.
Sharma attributed the spurt in human-elephant conflict in the last couple of months to the approaching harvesting season.",1

Angul (Orissa), Oct 26 (PTI) An elephant calf was electrocuted in Talcher forest range of Orissa's Angul district today.

This is the second such incident in the same forest range after the mishap at nearby Bairakuan last week where another female calf died after coming in contact with a live electric wire.

BHUBANESWAR: A seriously injured female elephant fled into the forest after locals shot at her in Kumarbasta village, about 30 km from here, on

Wednesday night. The animal, about 60-years-old, sustained three bullet injuries on her right leg, official sources said. 

The elephant is a member of a seven-member herd that strayed into the villages and paddy fields on the periphery of Chandaka sanctuary, spreading panic among villagers. 

DFO (Chandaka) A K Patnaik said, ""We are keeping an eye over the injured elephant. Though it separated from its herd in the morning, by evening it entered the forest and is close to its herd."" 

""The bullets fired at her are probably from a country-made gun. We would provide medical aid after the animal stops its movement. Otherwise, it will be difficult to capture it,"" he said. 

Bansidhar Mahalik, a villager, said, ""The herd entered the paddy field near our village on Thursday night. Many were chasing it. Someone might have shot at it. During winter, elephants stray into paddy fields in search of food and they even attack human beings and destroy houses. Every year, five to six persons die due to tusker attack in and around the sanctuary."" 

""People are aggrieved over the increasing elephant menace. Some of the angry villagers might have attacked the animal. Last year, an elephant was shot dead by villagers,"" a forest guard said.",1

November 30, 2009
Bangalore: Autopsy has revealed that the 30-year-old elephant found dead near Bannerghatta National Park (BNP) on Sunday, was, in fact, shot dead, sending shock waves among conservationists and forest officials.
Speaking to DNA, principal chief conservator of forests BK Singh said that one bullet was recovered from the female pachyderm's brain and another from the back. Alibis suggest that the first bullet might have hit her back, and the second bullet the forehead, killing her on the spot, he said.
The cow-elephant was shot with a muzzle loader gun. The forensic and post-mortem reports will be ready in five days.
Forest officials said that a herd of seven elephants was camping on a private land abutting the park, and was found trampling ragi crops of farmers of Attiguppe village. An eye-witness said that he saw a man with a gun entering the area where the elephants had been camping.
Officials are interrogating the eye-witness and other villagers of Attiguppe and Goddur. Investigation is on to ascertain the identity of the killer. It is possible that an agitated farmer might have resorted to the act as the body was not mutilated, and there were minor injuries on the legs and back of the pachyderm.
As per the law, a buffer zone of at least 50 metres should be maintained between forest and private land, which is absent on most of BNP borders. Also, the department's several efforts to train farmers around the park in preventing elephants from entering their fields have hardly been implemented.",1

An adult male elephant was found dead in the Mohand Forest Range in Saharanpur district on Tuesday night.



While the range has been put on poaching alert, three persons have been arrested as they were seen pulling away the animal.



According to Forest department officials, one tusk of the animal was missing and it had injury marks on its body.

Samples have been sent to the Institute of Veternary Research of India at Bareilly and Wildlife Institute of India for examination.



Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (Wildlife) B K Patnaik said: â€œThough the area where the elephantâ€™s body was found is not a poaching-prone area, we cannot rule out the possibility. But at times, when an animal dies due to some other reason, poachers or even locals can cut its tusks.â€

ANGUL, 5 JAN: An adult female elephant suffocated to death in a well after struggling for 12 hours to wriggle out, at Saluikham village, about one and half km away from Chhendipada forest range office. A pall of gloom descended on the area after the elephants death, which took place last morning.

All her struggle went in vain with forest, police and fire service department virtually turning a deaf ear to the repeated pleas of the locals to rescue the distressed pachyderm.

What brought tears in the eyes of the helpless spectators was that the calf of the trapped animal was making fervent pleas to the people to rescue its mother. The child elephant was pulling people to come to its mother who had fallen in the well. Sometimes, it also tried to collect woods and threw towards her mother in a bid to help her come out.

However, the struggle of both mother and child failed, much to the shock, dismay and anger of the people.

The villagers informed that the herd of elephants had strayed into the village on Sunday night. After being chased by people by crackers, all the animals dispersed except one elephant which fell into a three meter deep well with almost five of feet water. Her baby child stayed with her instead of fleeing with others. From 9 p.m. on Sunday, the elephant and its calf screamed for help but nobody turned up in fear.

The villagers alleged that they made frantic calls to ranger officer who reportedly was at Angul at that time. They also called Chhendipada police station who advised them to get in touch with forest officials. They also made calls to Angul fire station officials who could rescue the animal but they also did not turn up.

After struggling for the whole night the elephant finally died in the well, at about 8 a.m. on Monday. According to the report, the elephant in its bid to extricate itself, got trapped in the mud with her legs and truck stuck. The animal then suffocated and succumbed.

The forest department officials then rescued the calf and left it at the nearby forest where a herd reportedly took her back. Locals were aghast over the lackadaisical attitude of the government officials. The villagers, though they always complain that the elephant herds destroy properties and crops during harvest period, mourned the death of the animal and demanded stern action against the erring officials.

A 41 year old male domesticated elephant has been slaughtered for its body parts in Vientiane, with the hunt continuing for those responsible.



The attack took place a short 40 minute drive from central Vientiane in Nanga village, Naxaithong district, at the end of last month and appeared to be the work of at least two poachers.



The elephant, known as Phu Thongkhoun, belonged to Mr Somyod Phimasan, who was left distraught by the death, saying this was the third elephant he has lost to illegal poachers, totalling a loss of about US$40,000.



The two prior incidents occurred in Xieng Khuang province in 2007 and 2009, where he lived previously.



Elephant conservationists have expressed their concern about the illegal poaching, which they say is leading to a rapidly declining population.



This latest attack occurred at around 2am on February 26, when villagers who live near Mr Somyodâ€™s garden reportedly heard three gunshots, which they initially dismissed as hunters given the areaâ€™s proximity to woodland.



Mr Somyod said it was a tragedy to find his elephant killed, after he bought it for breeding purposes from Pakxe district, Champassak province.



â€œWe suspect people in the area are responsible, but we are still in the process of investigation,â€ he said.



He added that one of the poachers appeared to have dropped his sim-card in the area, which police are using to help in their investigation.



Mr Somyod contacted conservation group ElefantAsia to inform them of the illegal poaching and to ask for assistance in ascertaining the cause of death.



The groupâ€™s veterinarian, Dr Bertrand Bouchard, undertook an informal autopsy on the remaining body parts and concluded that Phu Thongkhoun died from at least three high-calibre bullets to the head and face. The elephantâ€™s ivory, tail, face and tip of the trunk were all removed, presumably for sale on the black market.



The elephant had large tusks, which probably contributed to his appeal to poachers.



By studying the bullets it appears that the poachers had access to high-powered guns, indicating that this was a deliberate attack undertaken by professional poachers or people with access to military grade firearms.



Asian elephants are an internationally recognised endangered species, and domesticated elephants in Laos face threats from many sources.



ElefantAsia know of at least three domesticated elephants that have been poached in the last two months, 10 since 2008, with not a single arrest in any of the cases.



Less than 500 domesticated elephants remain in Laos, with poaching a recurrent problem.



Local laws are clear regarding the killing of elephants. In 1989 the government declared a ban on the hunting and killing of protected, endangered species, and became signatories to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora in 2004.



However, poaching continues to be a major cause of death for both wild and domesticated elephant populations.



The mahout community feels vulnerable to poachers and is unable to independently help and protect their animals

Bagdogra (West Bengal), Mar 4 (ANI): Forest officials spotted a dead adult female elephant in the middle of the street in West Bengal's Bagdogra Forest Range on Thursday, carrying marks of injuries on its belly.



The cause of the death is yet to be ascertained.



Visiting forest officials confirmed the elephant's death. The incident which appears to have occurred on Wednesday night in mysterious circumstances has concerned the authorities here.



Meanwhile, the wildlife doctors of the state's Department of Forestry are conducting the animal's post-mortem.



Preliminary investigations revealed that the injury might have come from a bullet fired by a long-range rifle.



""There is one injury on the belly, on the right side of the belly. And it's quite deep injury; it does not seem to be from an arrow or spear. It seems to be a bullet injury and doesn't seem to be a local bullet. But still we have not been able to get the bullet,"" said Sunder Lal Bahuguna, Chief Conservator of Forest Administration, North Bengal.



""But I think that it can be an elephant, something has happened, or a tusk has inserted the belly that's another possibility. But post-mortem is still going on and we don't know what has happened exactly,"" he added.



North part of the West Bengal is home to wild elephants and the forest range of Bagdogra sees movement of around 120 to 150 elephants throughout the year.



A national census in 2005 showed there were 25,000 to 28,000 elephants in India, including only 1,500 male tuskers of breeding age.

Two elephants were electrocuted Monday when they bumped into high tension wires in Jharkhand's Khuti district, an official said Monday.



The incident took place near Nimidin village, some 60 km from here.



District forest officer Manel Tudu said elephants come regularly to the area in search of wheat crops. 'It seems one elephant hit an electric pole and snapped the high tension wires.'



More than 70 elephants have reportedly died in Jharkhand in the last nine years due to several reasons including electrocution.

JAKARTA â€” Poachers are suspected to have killed an endangered Sumatran elephant whose body was discovered by villagers with its tusks removed, Indonesian conservationists said Wednesday.



""We also found a stab wound on the right side of the chest, piercing through his liver,"" Mulyo Utomo from the nature conservation agency in Sumatra's Riau province told AFP.



The 10-year-old male elephant's body was found in Petani village in Riau province.



Conflicts between wild elephants and humans are on the rise on Sumatra, where settlements, plantations and industrial forest estates are rapidly reducing their natural habitat.



There are about 2,400 to 2,800 Sumatran elephants in Indonesia, of which 200 to 250 are in Riau, according to environmental group WWF. They are the smallest of the Asian elephants.

Two endangered elephants found dead on Indonesia's Sumatra island are believed to be the victims of poachers targeting the animals for their prized ivory tusks, a park official said Monday.



Hayani Suprahman, the head of Tesso Nelo National Park in Riau province, said Monday that the body of a 5-year-old male Sumatran elephant was discovered late Saturday with its tusks cut off with a saw. A second elephant, a 7-year-old male, was found Sunday about 100 yards (meters) away from where the first had been discovered, he said.



A preliminary investigation showed that the two elephants may have been deliberately poisoned by cyanide, he said.



""I believe that poachers are behind the elephant killings for money,"" Suprahman said.



Trade in ivory was banned in 1989 under a U.N. convention, but the black market in Indonesia pays about $2,200 per 2.2 pounds (kilogram) and even higher on international markets, according to the World Wildlife Fund for Nature.



Samples of the two animals have been sent to a laboratory to confirm the cause of the death, Suprahman said.



Two weeks earlier, another male elephant was killed near the Bengkalis district of Riau province, and its tusks were also removed. Police are investigating, though no arrests have been made.



Only 3,000 Sumatran elephants are believed to remain in the wild, a number that dwindles each year with poaching.



Last year, a dozen elephants were killed on Sumatra, while 18 were found dead in 2008, Suprahman said. Forensic tests showed some had eaten cyanide-laced pineapples while others had been shot in the head.

A mature elephant was found dead Wednesday near a lake and a stream in the Central Highlands province of Dak Lak.



Local residents found the elephant when catching fish in the stream in Ea Sup District.



The body was stinking and its bones were broken into pieces, they said. Officials surmised that the elephant had been trampled on and killed by others in the herd, making it hard to identify the animalâ€™s gender.



Many trees in the area had been felled, suspectedly by the other elephants, they added.



Dak Lak Province is home to the largest wild elephant population in Vietnam. Ethnic minorities in the province have a tradition of domesticating the animal.



Provincial figures late last year estimated it had between 83 and 100 wild elephants and 61 domesticated ones.



The province plans to set up a 200-hectare sanctuary for elephants this year at a cost of VND58 billion (US$3.05 million).

COIMBATORE: As summer scorches the forests in Tamil Nadu, two adult elephants have died of â€œexhaustionâ€ in the last four days in the dry Sathyamangalam jungles, apparently due to water and food shortage.



A 35-year-old makhna â€” a bull elephant without a tusk â€” died in the elephant haven of Thengumarahada in Bhavanisagar forest range in Sathyamangalam division on Monday evening. The postmortem examination conducted by forest department veterinarian revealed that the elephant had died of â€œimpaction,â€ a potential case of dehydration and colitis in the stomach.



On April 16, a 50-year-old female elephant was found dead at Kovilur forest area in T N Palayam. The elephant had lesions in liver and spleen, an indication that it had raided pesticide-laced food crops because of the fodder shortage in the jungles.



Elephants gulp at least 100 to 125 litres of water everyday. While healthy elephants can trudge long distances in search of water, â€œweak and sickâ€ animals are unable to â€œperambulateâ€ and succumb, says forest veterinarian Dr NS Manoharan. However, Sathyamangalam DFO, S Ramasubramaniam, insisted that there is no food or water scarcity in the forests. â€œWe have provided adequate water troughs for the animals. And it is not abnormal for elephants to die at 35 years in wild conditions,â€ he said. 



With the onset of summer, forests in western Tamil Nadu have been reeling under severe drought conditions and a spate of fire as well.



With fodder and water holes drying up in the jungles, elephants are raiding the agricultural fields in hamlets located on the forest fringes.



Meanwhile, a 40-year-old makhna was killed by a tusker in Thalavady forests on April 18. In a turf fight, the makhna was gored to death by the tusker, according to a forest official.



Besides drought conditions, viral diseases are also taking a toll on elephants. Last Sunday, a baby elephant died at a water trough at the Salim Ali Centre for Ornithology at Anaikatty in Coimbatore, due to â€œsevere viral infectionâ€.

People of Nayagram town in West Bengal's West Midnapore district staged a demonstration Sunday protesting against forest department officials shooting dead an elephant and injuring another.



While the forest officials claimed that the elephant killed Saturday was a rogue, the villagers claimed there was nothing abnormal in its behaviour.



'The elephant had been killing people for quite some time. So, under the Wildlife Protection Act we declared it as a rogue. Meanwhile, it entered Nayagram,' state Principal Conservator of Forests Atanu Raha told reporters here.



'When our hunters tracked it, they found it had another elephant as companion. When they shot dead the rogue, the other elephant charged at them. And in self-defence they had to shoot at the second pachyderm also,' Raha added.



Raha said he had received reports that the locals were agitating.



'I will enquire whether they tried to tranquilise the second elephant first,' he said.

Banda Aceh. A 15-year-old Sumatran elephant was poisoned last month for its tusks, environmental activists and officials confirmed on Sunday.



Kamal Faisal, chairman of environmental watchdog Tamiang Peduli, said dozens of people were involved in the death of the elephant on April 27 near a palm oil plantation owned by PT MPLI in Tamiang district.



He said the case only became public when a forest ranger, M Syahrizal, noticed the elephant missing from its group.



â€œThere were three elephants that lived in the area,â€ Faisal said. â€œTwo adults and one baby elephant.â€



Faisal said Syahrizal drove the elephants back to their habitat whenever they strayed too close to villages in the area. He said that it was only several days after the killing that the ranger realized one of the adult elephants was missing from the group.



Faisal said a farmer claimed he had witnessed the killing when he was working in his field.



â€œThe farmer saw dozens of people cutting up the dead elephantâ€™s tusks and meat,â€ he said.



Faisal said a small piece of tusk had been secured in his office, but that the farmer was too afraid too speak publicly because he had been threatened by the poachers.



He said it was possible that security officers at plantation company MPLI were involved, noting that no one at the company had yet to issue a statement on the killing.



â€œThe hunters could be people who have been illegally operating in the forests around Tamiang, and they could be working with the company,â€ he said, adding that he had reported the case to Acehâ€™s Natural Resources Conservation Agency.



Ridwan, an official at the agency, said it would send a team to the area today. â€œWe are deeply concerned by the case,â€ he said, adding that the agency would conduct a thorough investigation.



He said there had been cases in several districts in Aceh of elephants destroying homes and fields, but that some people were taking advantage of conflicts between humans and the animals.

A wild elephant which turned violent and damaged tourist vehicles parked at Echo Point near Munnar died on Monday morning. The pachyderm sustained injuries on its head from the vehiclesâ€™ broken windowpanes.



The elephant was down most of the time for the past three days in the reservoir. There were doubts whether it had swallowed plastic thrown by the tourists.



An elephant expert and veterinary surgeon would come from Kannur for a post-mortem examination on Tuesday, said the Munnar Divisional Forest Officer, S.G. Mahesh Kumar. The age of the elephant was around 50 years and only after a post-mortem examination would the real cause of the death be revealed, he said. â€œThere was a heavy rush of tourists in the area on Sunday and this might have caused the animal to turn violent,â€ he added.



Animal lovers here have demanded a thorough probe into the animalâ€™s death. The tusker was forced to come out of the forest after it was provoked by people who threw stones at it, said Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) district president M.N. Jayachandran.



He alleged that the Forest Department did not do anything to save the ailing animal which was lying in water. â€œWhen an elephant lies in water, it is a sign that the creature has some disease or physical problem. The Forest Department did not take care of the animal forcing it to enter the public place,â€ he said.



A thorough inquiry was sought into the death of elephants in wildlife sanctuaries in the district as this was not an isolated issue.

A baby elephant found dead in the southern province of Dong Nai on Thursday was very likely poisoned, a forensic expert said Friday.

 

The male elephant, weighing one ton, was found dead with its tongue sticking out, and tests found bleeding in its heart and liver.

 

They also found mango, manioc and jackfruit which were all fresh eaten in the three-year-old animalâ€™s stomach, said the expert who wished to stay unnamed.

 

Samples have been sent to Ho Chi Minh City for further tests, he said.

 

This is the seventh elephant to be found dead of unknown reasons in Dong Nai this year. Since its body was found soon after death, it will help related agencies learn more, he added.

 

The carcasses of the other elephants were found only after they'd already disintegrated.

 

He said mango and jackfruit seeds were also found in the other elephants' stomachs.

 

The latest dead elephant was found some 100 meters away from the Vinh Cuu Nature and Heritage Reserve in Phu Ly Commune.

 

An official working in Dong Naiâ€™s agriculture said local people in Ma Da Commune near the forest once threatened to poison elephants in the forest, if local agencies didnâ€™t take proper steps to protect their fields from the elephantsâ€™ raids.

Two elephant calves were killed in separate incidents in Assamâ€™s Kaziranga National Park on Saturday, officials said. 



According to report, a six-year old elephant calf died after it was hit by a speeding vehicle on NH-37 inside the park in the wee hours of Saturday.



â€œWhen the killed elephant calf was trying to cross the NH-37 at Amguri under Burapahar Forest Range office in the Park, a speeding vehicle, coming from Jorhat to Guwahati, hit the calf. It died on the spot,â€ a senior forest official said.



In a separate incident, a five-month elephant calf died after it fell into a deep pond in the northern range area inside the park on Saturday evening, officials said.



Kaziranga DFO Dibyadhar Gogoi told IBNS, â€œThe park authorities have taken steps to ensure safety of the animals that have migrated from the park. Vehicles, especially trucks, passing through NH-37 via Kaziranga National Park, have been imposed with restriction with regards to speed driving. Under Section 144, banning of speeding vehicles has been imposed and vehicles are ordered to drive under a limit speed of 40 km per hour.â€



Meanwhile, elephant, rhinos and other wild animals are fleeing from the park to safer areas of the adjacent Karbi Anglong hills in the south due to flood in the park.



During the flood situation many animals use the National Highway to cross over to the hill.



In the past, there have been many reports of animal deaths due to speeding vehicles, while they try to escape.



Animal,s such as deers, are often found dead in such instances.



While wildlife organizations are taking action for conservation and ensure safety of rhinos, elephants and other wild animals, the authorities of Assamâ€™s Kaziranga National Park have allegedly failed for ensure safety of animals inside the park.



Kaziranga National Park, a World Heritage Site, has two-thirds of the world's Great One-horned Rhinoceroses. Kaziranga is the highest density of tigers among protected areas in the world and was declared a Tiger Reserve in 2006. The park is home to large breeding populations of elephants, wild water buffaloes, and swamp deers.



It is to be mentioned that, 55 one-horned rhinoceros were killed by poachers in Kaziranga National Park in last four years.



Many cases were reported on man-elephant conflict across the state.



In last four years' report, around 70 people were killed and 500 others injured by wild elephants in various parts of the state.



More than 40 wild elephants were also killed during this period.

Guwahati: A five-year-old elephant was knocked down by a speeding truck on NH-37 near Kaziranga National Park, about 250 km from here, on Saturday. The elephant was hit on the head by the truck while it was crossing the road in the Amguri area under Burapahar forest range of the park around 5.15 am.



Movement of animals on the highway has increased following inundation of several parts of Kaziranga. During floods, animals from Kaziranga cross over the highway to reach higher grounds in Karbi Anglong district. ""Our guards man all the posts along the highway between Amguri and Kohra from evening to early morning for restricting vehicular speed. It is very unfortunate that the lone elephant was knocked down after the guards left their posts at 4 am,"" Kaziranga DFO D D Gogoi said. This was Kaziranga's first elephant casualty in highway accidents in five years. Last week, about three deer were run over by vehicles on the highway. Park officials said the elephant crossed the highway to feed on paddy on the other side of the park.



Increase of traffic along the highway has become a bane for Kaziranga, the only Unesco World Heritage Site in the state. About 2,000 vehicles take the highway everyday, considerably contributing pollution to Kaziranga. During night, about 500 trucks ply the highway. Soon after floods engulfed a sizeable part of 430 sq km national park last month, Kaziranga authorities started issuing time cards to vehicles taking the highway between Amguri and Kohra a distance of 37 km which they have to cover in not less than 51 minutes. The guards deployed at the two ends slap fine on the driver if a vehicle was found to have reached less than the prescribed time. ",1

Nagaon, Assam:  A male elephant has been found dead at the courtyard of a house inside Kalidan tea estate near Nagaon in Assam. It's unusual for an elephant to die in such circumstances unless electrocuted. Workers at the tea estate insist the elephant died of natural causes.



255 elephants have died in Assam as a result of conflicts with humans between 1990 and 2003. Most of them were poisoned or electrocuted.



Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh announced earlier this week that the government will declare the elephant a National Heritage Animal as part of a new initiative.



The Elephant Task Force - made up of 12 members - has also recommended setting up a National Elephant Conservation Authority, similar to the existing National Tiger Conservation Authority. The task force has presented the government with a comprehensive plan for how to protect elephants in the wild and in captivity, and alleviate the human-elephant conflict.

NEW DELHI: Even elephants need to tread with caution in Delhi's notorious traffic. Barely 24 hours after seven elephants were mowed down by a train in West Bengal, a blind tusker was hit by a speeding truck on Ring Road near the Kashmiri Gate ISBT late Thursday night. But unlike the wild herd, timely help by wildlife activists and the police ensured that Bholu, a full grown elephant, lived to see another day.



The badly injured elephant lay on the ground for four hours before he was helped on his feet by a crane brought in by the police around 2am. Kartick Satyanarayan of Wildlife SOS, who was on the spot, said it was crucial that the elephant was made to stand because it could have suffered multi-organ failure had it remained lying down.



""It is wonderful to see the cooperation and support from the Delhi Police. The Wildlife SOS and Friendicoes SECA teams were able to give much needed veterinary care to the elephant and hopefully the elephant will be saved,"" he said.



Abhishek Narayanan, also from Wildlife SOS, said the animal was being walked by its mahut without a reflector, which meant the elephant could hardly be seen from a distance. ""Walking an elephant at night with no reflectors is asking for trouble,"" he said.



The cops said that the incident was reported around 10pm. The elephant and its mahut, Suraj Pal (30), were on their daily journey from Laxmi Nagar to Wazirabad when tragedy struck. ""The elephant was taking a turn when the truck hit the elephant. The impact was such that both the elephant and mahut fell. Bholu hit against a boundary wall which aggravated its pain. The truck driver, identified as Rakesh Kumar, was also injured along with the mahut. Both of them were taken to Shusrut Trauma Centre, barely 400 metres from the accident site. Both were released after first aid,"" said a cop.



The truck driver was arrested and a case of rash and negligent driving registered against him. The truck was on his way from Faridabad to the Azadpur Market.



Two veterinary doctors, Dr K D Sharma and Dr Prasad, worked hard in dressing the wounds of the elephant and administered painkiller injections and antibiotics to treat the shock and trauma of the animal, whose condition continues to be serious.

Guwahati, Sept. 25: Power cables have turned into a death trap for denizens of Kaziranga National Park.



This came to light when rangers found the carcass of an adult male elephant, which was electrocuted at Kukurakata reserve forest in Burapahar range of the park a couple of days ago, this morning.



This is the first incident of an animal dying of electrocution in Kaziranga.



Terming the incident â€œan accidentâ€, park director Surajit Dutta said the mishap occurred because the elephant uprooted a tree that fell resulting in the snapping of the power cables.



Another forest official said low-lying power cables connected to a telephone tower in the area caused the accident. â€œThe elephant uprooted a tree in the area and it fell on the already low-lying cables. The elephant came in contact with the cables and was electrocuted,â€ he said, adding that the â€œincident was unfortunate.â€



The veterinarian who conducted a post-mortem on the carcass said there were clear signs of the elephant, which was about 50 years of age, being electrocuted.



A large number of birds, mostly parrots, had died of electrocution in the Bogoriguri area under Kohora range of the park a few years back.



There have also been instances of poachers using power lines to kill animals, especially rhinos. They laid cables connected to power lines running above. Such an incident had come to light in 2007. Cables laid on tracks used by animals were frequently recovered from the foothills of Karbi Anglong hills, adjacent to Kaziranga.



A Kaziranga official said the park authorities had made several appeals to the authorities to shift the power cables from the particular area to avoid such incidents.



The ministry of environment and forests has proposed a bill to be passed in Parliament making electrocution of animals a punishable offence.



By including the term â€˜electrocutingâ€™ in the definition of hunting, the Amendment Act seeks to explicitly make the act of electrocuting an animal a punishable offence.



Dispur has also set up joint co-ordination committees in every district to monitor the maintenance of transmission lines and prevent electrocution of elephants.



In another incident an elephant calf died after it was trapped in a drain at Numaligarh tea estate, 30km from Kaziranga, in Golaghat district this morning.

The spree of elephant deaths continued in North Bengal. Close on the heels of a speeding mail train mowing down seven elephants, two more calves were found dead in West Bengal's Buxa Tiger Reserve under mysterious circumstances on Saturday.



The two carcasses were gheraoed by jumbo herds making it difficult for the elephant squads to recover the bodies.



According to Rajendra Jakhar, Deputy Field Director, Buxa, the calves â€” one male and other female â€” were found to be lying at a distance of about 5 metres from each other. The carcasses were surrounded by two separate herds of elephants, numbering around 30.



â€œEven the local squads could not drive them away as they almost laid siege to the body till wee hours of Sunday. We could approach the site only after they had dispersed,â€ he said. The two had probably died shortly after birth, as placenta was found attached to their bodies, he pointed out.



He apprehended that the death of the calves could be due to certain infection at birth time. As per the guidelines of the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA), we have collected tissue samples from the dead animals for pathological examination, he said.



Meanwhile, the head of Project Elephant, AN Prasad, reached Jalpaiguri Division on Saturday to review the situation. In an emergency meeting with the State forest officials, including the CCF West Bengal, S Patel, and DRM Alipurdwar S Singh, Prasad stressed on more coordination between the departments.



â€œA control room would be set up at the Alipurdwar rail junction, which would be manned by forest and rail staff,â€ he said. In case any animal herd arrives, the control room would instantly alert the respective driver. The control room would also be in touch with the elephant squads.



The train would not cross the maximum speed limit of 45-50 kmph while crossing the 168-km sensitive zone through forests and corridor areas, the meeting decided. No mail train would cross the stretch at night. Further, the Railways would clear out vegetation and paddy land up to a distance of 30 metre on each side of the track for better visibility and to check jumbos, crossing the railway tracks to reach the fields.



A public notice would also be issued in nearby villages so that in case any animal is sighted near the tracks, the nearest railway station would be instantly informed, to prevent mishaps.



The meeting decided that top-level rail and forest officials would meet at an interval of three months to keep track of the situation. A two-member review committee of rail and forest officials has been constituted for monthly meetings. The Railways has offered to help the forest officials, if necessary, for recovery of bodies in case of accidents.



In another incident, locals of Jalpaiguri forest division have decided to observe an elaborate 'shraadh' ceremony, in memory of the deceased elephants on Monday in accordance with the Hindu rites.

SURAT THANI : The consumption of pesticide is being looked at as a possible cause of death of a male elephant found dead in a vegetable garden, officials say.



The 30-year-old wild elephant with two perfect tusks measuring about 60cm each was believed to have died at least 20 hours before it was found in a vegetable garden yesterday near Khlong Kratae in Kanchanadit district.



The animal suffered from diarrhoea and internal bleeding before it died, said a veterinarian who was among a team from Tai Romyen national park that rushed to the scene.



Traces of pesticide were found about 30metres from the elephant, and officials said it was possible the animal had eaten some.



Garden owner Tiang Srisuk, 45, said she went to pick vegetables and found her makeshift shelter had been damaged.



Small bags of pesticide which were kept inside the shelter had fallen to the ground and some vegetable plots were damaged. Ms Tiang said she followed footprints and found the dead elephant.



Sukrit Krataichan, head of the national park, said an autopsy would be held.



Veerakiart Lakkhachai, chief of the Tai Romyen forestry development project, said elephants living around the national park foraged for food in nearby villages.

Guwahati:  Two elephant calves died of suspected poisoning in a tea estate near Kaziranga National Park in Assam's Golaghat district, officials said on Thursday.



The carcass of the calves, a male and female were found in Diffloo Tea Estate on Wednesday and forest officials suspected this to be a case of poisoning as the tongues and eyes of both the animals had turned blue, they said.



Pesticides were sprayed inside the tea garden and this could have poisoned the elephants.



The viscera of both the calves have been sent to the forensic laboratory for tests, the Estate manager Rajshekhar Dutta said.



However, Dutta denied that the elephants had died due to pesticide poisoning saying ""we have been using the pesticide for a long time. If it was a case of pesticide poisoning, elephants who regularly visit our gardens and other cattle would have died earlier but no such cases have been reported.""



He said that an enquiry would be conducted to ascertain the cause of the death of the elephants.

An elephant belonging to the Nagarhole tiger reserve was paralysed after it suffered a bullet wound in its spine. The tusker, aged around 16 years, fell into a ditch in Aanechowkur range of the national park after suffering injuries.



The elephant was found by a team of forest officials while patrolling on Thursday afternoon. Later, the team returned to the spot with a camp elephant to try and pull out the tusker from the ditch.



Speaking to DNA, Nagarhole tiger reserve deputy conservator of forests Vijay Ranjan Singh said that the pachyderm was unable to move its pelvic region.



Since it was already night, the elephant was administered glucose in the ditch. The rescue operation resumed on Friday morning, but was of no use. While the camp elephant tried to pull up the fallen tusker, a bullet wound was noticed in its spine.



Ruling out poaching in the incident, he said that it was a case of the elephant being injured while it was trying to raid a private farm land. In poaching cases, elephants would be usually shot in the head and attempt would be made to remove the tusks.



But this elephant had been shot in the spine and its tusks were intact. Attempts are still on to bring the elephant out of the ditch and feed glucose to it. A search is on for the person who allegedly shot it.

GUWAHATI, India â€” A growing tussle for land between farmers and wild elephants in northeast India has resulted in the suspected poisoning deaths of four elephants in the past week, officials said Friday.



Officials in Assam state believe the four animals were deliberately poisoned by lacing home-made alcohol with toxic chemicals.



""We have taken the matter very seriously and already an enquiry by the chief wildlife warden is on and strict action will be taken against anyone found guilty of poisoning the elephants,"" state forest minister Rockybul Hussain told AFP.



Two calves died at the Diffolu tea garden, close to the Kaziranga National Park, about 220 kilometres (140 miles) east of Assam's main city of Guwahati on October 7.



Two days later a pregnant elephant was found dead on the periphery of the park, followed by an adult tusker just outside the sanctuary.



""In almost all the cases, the tongues had turned blue indicating that the elephants could have consumed something toxic,"" a veterinarian who examined the bodies said.



Hussain said preliminary investigations suggested locals in the Diffolu tea garden might be responsible.



In 2009, four elephants were poisoned and killed by angry villagers after going on the rampage in local paddy fields and villages, killing at least two people.



Wildlife officials said the locals had mixed the poison with home-made liquor that is brewed from fermented rice and often sought out by elephants.



Experts say shrinking forest cover and human encroachment on elephant corridors have forced the animals to stray out of their natural jungle habitat into human settlement areas.



""More often than not, they are attracted by the smell of locally brewed rice beer,"" said Kushal Konwar Sharma, a noted elephant expert and a teacher at the College of Veterinary Science in Guwahati.



A recent report by the wildlife department said wild Asiatic elephants have killed about 279 people in Assam since 2001, while 289 elephants have died during the period, many of them victims of human retaliation.



The last elephant census carried out by wildlife authorities recorded about 5,500 elephants in Assam, more than half of India?s count of 10,000.

In the last few days, four elephants - two of them calves - have been found dead in the area, the most recent was discovered in the Panbari Reserve Forest. All are suspected to have died of poisoning.



Panbari is one of the most important animal corridors in the country, but the corridor has been choked with more than a hundred stone quarries.



The impact of that on wildlife is compounded by the tea estates in the area which chemical pesticides and toxic weedicides. 



It's not clear whether the poisioning was deliberate. But the conflict between elephants and humans has been rising. This year, elephant herds from near-by Karbianglong have destroyed fully-grown rice paddy in at least ten villages in Kaziranga.



In September, the government announced that the elephant would be given National Heritage Animal status, which would entitle it to the same level of protection as the tiger. A task force set up to draft policy has presented an agenda that tackles the diversifying conflict with humans, as well as the loss of habitat. However, it has not touched upon the issue of pesticides in eco-sensitive zones.



""There is no measure as of now and we have enough laws, it's the implementation which is lacking,"" says Rathin Barman, Coordinator of the Wildlife Trust of India.



Last month, pictures of seven elephants  run over by a speeding train in Siliguri in West Bengal had people all over the country cringing. It also became a sore point between the Railways Ministry and Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh.

DAK LAK â€” A tamed elephant with beautiful tusks found last week with hundreds of cuts on his body has been in critical condition, Buon Don District officials said.



The tusker was found in a forest near the Ban Don Eco-tourism Company's office in the Central Highlands province of Dak Lak.



Thieves attacked the three-tonne elephant, named Pac Ku, with the intention of killing him and removing his 70cm tusks, local people say.



It is the second time that Pac Ku has been attacked, they add.



The elephant was brought from Gia Lai Province to carry tourists two years ago. Last week, he was left in the forest to feed when villagers nearby heard harrowing cries.



Le Van Ha, the mahout, was not able to find his charge. Blood was scattered around the place he had tied the animal. He said he found many human footprints at the place and along Se Re Pok River where the elephant had tried to escape from his hunters.



The next day, after several hours of searching, company staff found the elephant at the river bank about five kilometres from the company's office.



His tail had been cut and two rear legs carried burn marks.



Le Thi Thanh Ha, director of the Ban Don Tourism Company, said poachers who want to steal elephant tails and tusks had acted ruthlessly.



The elephants are usually let to roam in the forests at night so that they can feed and even treat themselves with herbs, she said.



District police and forest rangers have trying to track the people who attacked the elephant.



Three months ago, while he was feeding with other three elephants in the forest, Pac Ku had been attacked by poachers who tied him to a tree and tried to cut off his tusks. Fortunately he escaped, although his wounds have not healed completely.



The latest attack has left the 30-year-old elephant in a bad state, local officials said.



The Central Highlands region has been suffering the scourge of elephant thieves for several years now. Just four months ago, five elephants working at the Prenn Falls Tourism Area in Lam Dong Province lost their tails.



The elephants are having to suffer the consequences of a widely-held superstitious belief that their tail hairs bring good luck. These days, it is hard to find an elephant in the Central Highlands that has an undamaged tail.



According to Phan Dac Mau Dai, who has two elephants that had their tails cut recently in Da Lat, a whole tail sells for VND150 million (US$7,500). The hairs are then taken from the tails to make rings that people wear.

Idukki (Ker),Oct 24 (PTI) A wild elephant that strayed into a private cardamom estate died after falling into a pond at Pethotty near Santhanpara in the district. Forest department sources said the about 15-year-old female elephant might have accidentally fallen in the 14 ft-deep pond sometime on Friday night. On seeing the elephant struggling for life in the pond yesterday morning, the estate owner informed Devikulam Divisional Forest Office, from where forest guards led by DFO Mahesh Kumar reached the spot. They tried to empty the pond by pumping water from it. Fire and Rescue personnel from Munnar also reached the place to help save the elephant, but the pachyderm died by around 2 pm yesterday, the sources said. The carcass was later dragged out from the pond and cremated after post-mortem.

A wild elephant that had been saved from drowning in the sea off Sampur in Trincomalee a few months ago by the Sri Lanka Navy and released to the jungle was found dead last night in a well in Jayanthipura in Trincomalee. 



Few months ago the elephant had been caught in a current and swept farther into the deep sea when the Navy spotted it. The jumbo had been roaming in the Sampur and Trincomalee areas and was being monitored by the Wildlife Conservation officials.



The residents of the area said the bull-elephant had fallen into the recently dug up well at about 10.30 pm on Monday night. They said the jumbo with a huge body had been trapped in the well without being able to move about.

GUWAHATI, India â€” Indian environmentalists voiced outrage on Wednesday over the slaughter of an elephant calf in the northeastern state of Assam.



Villagers armed with sticks speared the baby elephant to death Tuesday after it strayed into a paddy farm in the state's Morigaon district, some 60 kilometres (37 miles) from Guwahati, Assam?s largest city.



The attack occurred in the presence of police and a forest warden, video footage of the killing broadcast on television showed.



""This is an outrageous incident, purely barbaric, to find villagers literally torturing the helpless elephant to death and that too in front of two security people,"" said wildlife conservationist Kushal Konwar Sarma.



""This was an inhuman act and needs to be condemned in the strongest possible terms,"" said Bibhab Talukdar, secretary general of Aaranyak, a wildlife conservation group in the northeast.



He called for an official probe into the incident.



Man-elephant conflicts are on the rise in India as villagers and farmers encroach on the natural habitats of pachyderms.

Desperate villagers rig garden fences with live electric wire



The residents of several villagers in the surrounding area of Buddhangala Sanctuary are living in constant fear of wild elephants that roam into populated areas at dusk. Recently, two houses in Tissapura colony were razed to the ground and a large stock of paddy devoured by a herd of elephants that entered the colony in the dead of night. Villagers say that the 40 km long electric fence around the Buddhangala Sanctuary had not been maintained for a long time and that the broken wires were lying on the ground. Meanwhile villagers have placed live electric wires on their garden fences to prevent the elephants from roaming into their gardens. However, this modus operandi has resulted in the death of wild elephants of electric shock. The latest was the death of a jumbo in a home garden of Ruhunugama. In this issue, the Wildlife Conservation Department blame the villagers for not cooperating with the department to maintain the electric fence adding that placing  live electric wires in home gardens to counter wild elephant intrusions was a punishable offence.

NAYAGRAM (WEST MIDNAPORE): A tusker that had sustained a bomb injury two days ago died on Sunday night in Pungiri village in West Midnapore's Nayagram. The autopsy on Monday, however, couldn't determine whether the elephant had succumbed to the bomb injury in its forehead or a heart attack it suffered due to the sound of bombs villagers burst to scare it away.



Mrinal Kanti Mondal, divisional forest officer of the Kharagpur range, said they have now decided to send viscera samples of the dead elephant to the forensic laboratory at the Bengal Veterinary College and Hospital at Belgachia to ascertain the cause of death.



The tusker that belonged to a herd of 50 elephants from Dalma had gone amok and entered the village when it was attacked by villagers. The bomb injury left a wound in its forehead but it didn't necessarily indicate that it was the cause of death, veterinary surgeon Ranjit Mondal said in his autopsy report. Villagers said the elephant suddenly collapsed in Pungiri while it was roaming around.



An elephant calf had died in the same village on November 14. The calf fell into a ditch and a tusker tried to lift it. In the process, the adult elephant ended up boring his tusks into the stomach of the calf, killing it.



Forest officials said a herd of 120 Dalma elephants had entered West Midnapore around July. Around 80 members of this herd walked across to Orissa on November 9 while the splinter group of 40 remained in the Nayagram and Sankrail areas of the district. Fifty of the 80 elephants that had gone to Orissa returned on November 29. These two splinter herds of 50 and 40 roamed around separately in the forests bordering Sitalpura, Purchiboni, Malam and other villages of Nayagram. They would often enter villages and destroy homes and crops and had even killed a man last month. Villagers often chased them with torches and also burst crude bombs.



About 100 villagers on Monday demonstrated before Nayagram forest range officer Ashoke Sen to protest against the forest department's failure to compensate them for damages elephant attacks had caused them.

November 24, 2010: A giant tusker, corralled from Galgamuwa, died last night when the floor boards of the lorry in which he was being transported, gave way resulting in the pachyderm crashing on to the tarmac causing mortal wounds.



â€œThe Galgamuwa Tusker was being taken to a reserve when the tragedy occurred around 8pm at Thambuttegama,â€ said Veterinarian Tharaka Prasad, Acting Deputy Director of the Wild Life Department.



Attempts had been made to release the elephant to the Siyambalangamuwa area in an effort to save his life, but the effort had failed, said Dr. Prasad.



The elephant, with tusks about 5 feet long, is considered the pachyderm in the wilds with the longest pair of tusks.



The tusker had killed a woman and attacked three others in the Mahagalgamuwa, Koneweva and Ganedivelwewa areas during the last few days. The Wild Life officials took measures to corral the elephant thereafter.

Well-known wildlife photographer Vajira Wijegunawardane recalls his encounter earlier this year, with the magnificent tusker that died tragically last Tuesday, while being translocated by the Department of Wildlife Conservation



â€œThere are few elephants that can literally take your breath away. â€˜Parakramaâ€™, named after King Parakramabahu the Great, is one of them. It was the fourth day, and the last opportunity to get a glimpse of this elusive but magnificent tusker. We had gone on foot with great trepidation, through scrub jungle, on information given by villagers, along an elephant corridor.



â€œThrough dense jungle we arrived at an open area, where, in the distance was a tank with hardly any water. From the bund, I could see an elephant hovering within the thick jungle canopy. My only hope was that it would be the tusker. I hid behind a tree. Due to weight constrains for the hard trek, I was armed only with a 70-200mm f2.8 lens. Within a few minutes the elephant emerged. It was indeed the tusker.



â€œMy heart stopped, as I saw the magnificent tusks shining dully, their full length hidden by the foliage. This was undoubtedly the largest tusker I had ever seen in this country. I felt so fortunate to see this animal. It was amazing how he had survived all these years, but was pleasantly reminded that its elusiveness and difficulty to track, was the very reason it was still alive.â€



This is what I recorded earlier this year. On Wednesday, I heard the tusker was to be relocated, but never did I expect another call early the following morning, to hear of its death. The very fact that a majestic creature like this was roaming the jungles of Sri Lanka, was something all Sri Lankans would have been proud of, as its tusks were longer than even most African elephantsâ€™. I consider myself very fortunate to have been able to photograph this elusive elephant.



The tusker population in this country is minimal, and this particular tusker was no ordinary one, just like the Kumana crossed tusker, who became a victim of a poacher. Animals like this are irreplaceable, and, as nature lovers, all we can ask of the concerned authorities is to come up with a mechanism to ensure the remaining tuskers that are still roaming the jungles in our beautiful isle, be protected, as they are indeed national treasures.



We urge the authorities to engage interested corporate bodies, organisations and individuals who will willingly contribute the required resources for the success of this endeavour. The Sri Lankan elephant, which is a distinct sub species of the Asian elephant, is only found in our country, which all of us should value, and not take for granted.

JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) â€” Five endangered Sumatran elephants have been found dead in Indonesia, and conservationists said Sunday that they suspect farmers poisoned the animals to stop them from damaging crops.



The elephants â€” four females and one male all under the age of 5 â€” were found dead late Friday in Riau province on Sumatra island, said Edi Susanto, a government conservationist.



Susanto suspects that owners of nearby palm oil plantations used cyanide to poison the animals, which are known for damaging crops. He said an investigation is under way and samples from the dead elephants have been sent for analysis.



""We have told the district heads in Riau province to ban farmers from tending crops in the woods where the elephants search for food,"" Susanto said.



Only 3,000 Sumatran elephants are believed to remain in the wild, a number that dwindles each year with poaching and killing by farmers angry over crop losses. The animals are prized by poachers for their ivory tusks.

Two wild Asian elephants were electrocuted after accidentally touching a high-voltage wire Monday on a highway in southwest China's Yunnan Province, the local government said Wednesday.



The bodies of a mother and a cub were found on a highway in Mengman township, Mengla County of Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture, said Zhang Guoying, a press official with the Nature Reserve Administration in Xishuangbanna.



""We received reports of the accident at 8:30 a.m. Monday and sent a team of 30 investigators and vets to the site,"" said Zhang. ""The accident was believed to have happened at around 2 a.m.""



Zhang said the investigators saw clear evidence of electrocution, including burns on the carcases and remnants of charred wires.



""They assume the elephants were hit by a broken wire as they walked by,"" he said.



A villager said the two were among a group of 10 wild elephants that roamed the town. ""They came from a nearby mountain. All the rest left after the accident,"" he said, giving only his surname as Li.



The adult elephant was about 30 years old, 2.56 meters tall and weighed 3.1 tonnes. The cub was estimated to be 3 years old, was 1.25 meters tall and weighed 400 kg.



Their carcases were kept at a research institute of the Xishuangbanna Nature Reserve, where they would be used as specimens in anatomical studies, Zhang said.



The virgin rainforests of Xishuangbanna are home to more than 250 wild Asian elephants, about 90 percent of China's total. The heaviest elephant weighs more than 5 tonnes.



In Xishuangbanna, bananas, sugarcane, corn and dry rice have been planted over 200 hectares for wild elephants that roam the area.

BANDA ACEH, Indonesia â€” Three endangered Sumatran elephants have been found dead after their herd rampaged through a village in western Indonesia, a conservationist and officials said Thursday.



The cause of the animals' deaths is being investigated but a local conservationist said they might have died after eating poison intended for wild boars as they scavenged for food at village stores.



""Three elephants have been killed. We don't know the cause but we have sent a team to the location to find out,"" Aceh province conservation agency chief Abubakar Chek Mat said.



""Conflict between elephants and residents happens often in this location and we're trying to find a solution to drive the elephants back to their habitat.""



Bakhtiar, an activist with local environmental group Leuser International Foundation, said a herd of elephants had sent villagers fleeing.



""For the past week, dozens of Sumatran elephants have gone to the village in east Aceh district and destroyed houses and crops, forcing 50 villagers to seek refuge elsewhere,"" he said.



""When the people returned home yesterday, they found three elephants dead. They said the elephants might have consumed poison meant for wild boars.""



Human-animal conflicts are a rising problem as people encroach on wildlife habitats in Indonesia, an archipelago with some of the world's largest remaining tropical forests.



Bakhtiar said his group and the local authorities are planning to bring tame elephants to the area to help chase any straying herd back into the forest.



""These tame elephants have been specially trained to do so. This is a more effective method than the present one used by the residents which is to fire homemade bamboo cannons in the hope that the sounds would scare the elephants away,"" he added.



There are up to 3,350 Sumatran elephants remaining in the wild, according to the environmental group WWF.

The autopsy on Monday, however, couldn't determine whether the elephant had succumbed to the bomb injury in its forehead or a heart attack it suffered due to the sound of bombs villagers burst to scare it away.



Mrinal Kanti Mondal, divisional forest officer of the Kharagpur range, said they have now decided to send viscera samples of the dead elephant to the forensic laboratory at the Bengal Veterinary College and Hospital at Belgachia to ascertain the cause of death.



The tusker that belonged to a herd of 50 elephants from Dalma had gone amok and entered the village when it was attacked by villagers. The bomb injury left a wound in its forehead but it didn't necessarily indicate that it was the cause of death, veterinary surgeon Ranjit Mondal said in his autopsy report. Villagers said the elephant suddenly collapsed in Pungiri while it was roaming around.



An elephant calf had died in the same village on November 14. The calf fell into a ditch and a tusker tried to lift it. In the process, the adult elephant ended up boring his tusks into the stomach of the calf, killing it.



Forest officials said a herd of 120 Dalma elephants had entered West Midnapore around July. Around 80 members of this herd walked across to Orissa on November 9 while the splinter group of 40 remained in the Nayagram and Sankrail areas of the district. Fifty of the 80 elephants that had gone to Orissa returned on November 29. These two splinter herds of 50 and 40 roamed around separately in the forests bordering Sitalpura, Purchiboni, Malam and other villages of Nayagram. They would often enter villages and destroy homes and crops and had even killed a man last month. Villagers often chased them with torches and also burst crude bombs.



About 100 villagers on Monday demonstrated before Nayagram forest range officer Ashoke Sen to protest against the forest department's failure to compensate them for damages elephant attacks had caused them.

Ranchi, Dec 22 (IANS) Two elephants were electrocuted when they came in contact with a high-voltage cable in Jharkhand's Gumla district Wednesday, police said.



According to the police, the elephants were killed in Londra village that comes under Bharno police station of Gumla district, around 140 km from here. The elephants hit an electric pole in a field and a wire carrying around 11,000 volts of power fell on them. Both died on the spot.



Around 30 elephants have been killed due to electrocution in Jharkhand in the last ten years. The forest officials blame the electricity board for such incidents. The height of wires carrying high-voltage is low in many areas, so the elephants are often electrocuted.

A new epidemic, Haemorr-hagic Septicaemia (HS), has killed six wild elephants in just 20 days in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. The Forest Department fears this deadly outbreak may spread to ungulates such as wild bison, deer and other animals too.

Three female elephants died at Bailur Forest Range in Biligiri Ranga Temple Wildlife Sanctuary (BRTWS) of Karnataka, while three others were killed in the bordering Sathyamangala forest of Tamil Nadu.

This range falls in the Nilgiri biosphere, which is home to 6,000 Asiatic elephants. It is a major migratory route linking three States.

Principal Chief Conservator of Forests and chief wildlife warden BK Singh spoke to The Pioneer about the grim situation. â€œThe reason for the spread of this virus is grazing of domestic animals inside the park. We have instructed grazers not to let the domestic herd into the forest. It is quite serious,â€ Singh said.

â€œThis disease spreads fast in the winter. We have also made sure that village cattle have been vaccinated. We have been keeping a strict vigil on cattle movement. Now, we have to wait and watch,â€ he added.

Institute of Animal Health & Veterinary Biologicals director Renuka Prasad said the disease, which spreads through saliva discharge, can take two forms â€” pneumonia and intestinal. Unvaccinated animals can die within a week.

The initial signs of the disease are general dullness, a reluctance to move and high temperature. Then salivation and nasal discharge appear and edematous swellings are seen in the throat, which spread to the rest of the body. Visible mucous membranes are congested and respiratory distress is soon followed by collapse. Recovery is rare. The animal dies within 3 to 36 hours.

According to Professor R Sukumar â€” world-renowned elephant expert and director of Centre for Ecological Sciences at Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore â€” this bacterial disease spreads through direct contact, contaminated food and water. 

The latest crisis for the Karnataka Forest Department comes in the wake of a spate of tiger deaths at Bannerghatta National Park near Bangalore.

7.1.2011 (UNI) Karnataka High Court today issued notice to the Centre and Karnataka government, returnable in four weeks, on the steps taken to prevent death of elephants due to electrification of fences in agriculture fields.

Chief Justice Khehar directed both the governments to study the report submitted by a Committee appointed, on a suo-motu petition and come out with measures it intends to take to prevent recurrence of elephant deaths.

The Committee, comprising wildlife and forest officials, was appointed by the Court last year following reports of death of elephants in the state either due to electrocution or shooting down of pachyderms which stray into agricultural fields and destroy the crops.

Meanwhile, in the last two days, three elephant calves were electrocuted in an agricultural field at Hassan, about 200 km from here. Two calves-an 18 nonth-old male calf and a five month-old female calf, were killed in the incident of Vatepur in Alur Taluk in Hassan District. This morning one more calf was killed due to electrocution.

Officials, however, stated that there was no fencing and the mishap could have been due to faulty earthing of a motor fitted in an agricultural field. The cause of the death would be known after post mortem.

In a heart-rending incident, an elephant refused to move away from the carcasses of its dead calves and stood beside them the whole day, protecting them and moving them, in the hope that they will come back to life again.

The incident occurred at Vatepur of Alur taluk in Hassan district in the wee hours on Thursday. 

The two calves, a one-and-a-half-year-old male calf and a five-month-old female, were moving with their herd, when they reportedly died from electrocution. Villagers informed the forest department when they spotted the mother elephant in the paddy field belonging to a farmer, Poovaiah.

The mother elephant stood protecting the dead calves and did not allow anybody to approach the carcasses. Though the mother left the place when the forest staff burst crackers, it returned after it saw an earthmover coming closer to the carcasses and pushed it away. The officials are planning to wait till Friday morning for the elephant to leave the place.

There is actually no electric fencing around the place where the carcasses were found. However, villagers told Deccan Herald that there was a grounding problem in the motor of one of the pumpsets in the field, which might have led to the electrocution of the calves.

â€œThough it looks like the calves were electrocuted, only post-mortem reports can establish the cause of the deaths,â€ said forest officer Ambaadi Madhav.  

Principal Chief Conservator of Forests and Chief Wildlife Warden, BK Singh, said that since post-mortem had not been conducted, an FIR was filed.

Alur farmers have lost their crops to elephants entering their fields in recent times. Some farmers have also lost their lives in elephant attacks.

Another elephant calf was found dead at Navilahalli Bellarykoppal in Alur Taluk of Hassan district on Friday.

It is said it might have died of electrocution. With this, three elephants have died in the last two days. The dead calf was around six months.

Following the calvesâ€™ deaths, a herd of elephants is moving in the surrounding areas. The officials of the forest department have warned the people to be careful while moving on
Alur-Magge Road as the herd was sighted there.

The elephant deaths have shocked the villagers as well as animal lovers. On Friday morning, the forest staff led by Deputy Conservator of Forests Ambadi Madhav managed to venture near the carcasses of two elephant calves, as the mother elephant had moved out of their vicinity.

Amid fear of being attacked by the herd, the veterinarians conducted the post mortem on the spot and confirmed the deaths were due to electrocution.

The forest department has lodged a complaint in this regard.

Returns

After spending the whole day near the carcasses, the mother elephant returned to the forests in the early hours of Friday. It did not allow anyone to near the carcasses and guarded them throughout the night.

The sight of mother elephant nudging the dead calves as if asking them to wake up was heart-rending. Understanding it, the forest officials called off their operation on Thursday.

After the postmortem, the bodies were cremated near the fields.

Madhav told mediapersons that prima facie evidences showed the calves had died from electrocution. Cases would be registered against the owners in whose land the calves were found dead. If the Union government gives permission, an elephant sanctuary would be developed in the district, or all the wild elephants would be relocated.

Spotted

In the meantime, two wild elephants were found near Dadamahalli Gudde near Halagur in Maddur taluk of Mandya district, after straying from the Muttathi forests. The efforts made by the forest officials to drive them back to the forests, failed.

On receipt of information, hundreds of villagers gathered at the spot preventing the forest officials from carrying out the operation. The officials say the jumbos have come to Dadamahalli Gudda from Muttathi forests via Rottikatte, Shimsha, Dhanagur and Banasamudra and also crossed National Highway 207.

On the way, the elephants damaged ragi crop. As the harvesting is over in the villages situated on the fringes of forests, the elephants strayed out of the forests in search of food.

Forest officer D Devaraj said steps were being taken to drive back the jumbos to Muttathi or Basavanabetti forests.

By Subir Bhaumik, BBC News
12 January 2011 

Forestry officials in the north-east Indian state of Assam have demanded the creation of a no-pesticide zone around the famous Kaziranga game sanctuary.

The call follows the deaths of two pregnant elephants and other animals in tea estates around Kaziranga.

The national park is renowned for its varied wildlife, especially the tiger and the one-horned Indian rhino.

Officials say that animals and birds were killed after eating grass that was contaminated by pesticides.

The two elephants ventured out of the park in search of food and ate grass which had been sprayed to kill red ants, officials say.

""The death of these elephants has brought the pesticide issue to the limelight, because the chemicals sprayed in tea estates are playing havoc with wildlife in our forests which are surrounded by hundreds of tea estates,"" said Anurag Singh, a senior forestry official in northern Assam where Kaziranga is located.

The area has the highest concentration of tea estates in India.

""The managements of these estates must turn to organic farming and stop spraying chemicals,"" Mr Singh said.
'Endangering our wildlife'

He added that hundreds of birds have died in the same area as has livestock which has eaten pesticide-laced grass in recent weeks.
""The cows died in their dozens and the vultures who fed on them also died in large numbers. So you can imagine the effect on human health when consumers drink these teas,"" Mr Singh said.

He said the forestry department was contemplating the prosecution of some tea estates if animals - especially those that are endangered - are killed by the pesticides.

Local community groups also support a pesticide ban.

""The tea estates should go organic and stop spraying random pesticides. They are not only endangering our wildlife and aquatic life but also our people,"" said Moni Manik Gogoi, who heads a ""people's committee"" near Kaziranga.

Some tea estate owners have also supported the call, especially those who run estates which are fully organic.

""Unless we all go organic, our teas will be under a scanner and we will lose lucrative markets where consumers are very health conscious,"" said Binod Saharia, owner of the Gossainbarie tea estate near Kaziranga.

But some planters are wary of losing out if they make the transition.

""The tea industry is so used to chemicals because they represent the easy option when combating plant diseases like halepeltis,"" said HS Siddhu, a veteran tea planter in Northern Assam.

He said the planters should be persuaded rather than being forced to convert to organic farming.

An image has emerged from Sri Lanka of a dead elephant calf stuck high in a tree after getting caught up in the country's fast-flowing floods.

The animal was found near the Kaloya river in northern Sri Lanka, which rose 18ft (5.5m) above its normal height.

Local villagers alerted photographer Kanchana Kumara Ariyadasa, who took the picture on Thursday.

He believes the photo will be a defining image of the country's recent heavy flooding.

""I have been working as a journalist for the last 10 years but this is likely to be one of the strangest photos I will ever take in my career,"" Mr Ariyadasa told the BBC.

""The animal is still stuck in the tree as we speak while wildlife officials work out the best way to get it down to conduct a post-mortem examination.""

Thousands of animals - including elephants, snakes, water buffaloes and livestock - are thought to have perished in the floods.

More than 30,000 army, navy, police and air force personnel are currently battling to provide urgent aid to people hit by the disaster.

At least 23 people have died and more than a million have been affected by the flooding, which the government says has displaced more than 325,000 people.

Colombo: Some 50 wild elephants have been killed due to the devastating Sri Lankan floods, which has displaced over a million people, according to the country's Wildlife Conservation Department.

Chandrawansa Pathiraja, the Director General of Sri Lanka Wildlife Conservation Department, said around 50 wild elephants have been reported killed due to floods.

He was quoted a saying by the ColomboPage online that a survey has been commenced in wildlife parks to ascertain the exact number of deaths of the wild elephants and other animals.

Local media recently published photos of a corpse of a baby elephant that was stuck between tree branches when it was washed away in floods.

Several wild animals also believed to have been perished due to floods.

Floods severely affected Lahugala, Somawathi, Maduruoya, Kumana and Kavudulla wildlife parks.

A large number of cattle have also been reported killed due to masssive floods.

United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) reported that livestock losses will be significant, particularly in Batticaloa district, the report said. The UN agency reported that 48,679 cattle, 22,279 goats, and 172,884 poultry have been lost.

More than a million people have been affected by the flooding in Sri Lanka and at least 37 have died over a week of devastation that has severely hit the centre and east of the country, including areas already destroyed by a three-decade civil war that ended in 2009.

Now the threat of water-borne diseases loomed with water levels receding after the devastation caused by the monsoon floods.

A large number of those displaced were those who had only recently been resettled after decades of ethnic conflict between Tamil Tiger rebels and government forces.

Both local and international aid agencies said the water levels were rapidly going down with many people able to go back to their homes to assess the damage.

The authorities are yet to assess the extent of damage, but officials said vast tracks of rice and vegetable farms were destroyed and livestock also badly affected.

UN agencies in the capital plan to issue an international appeal for funding as providing relief for those in the worst affected areas was becoming a serious challenge.

India responded quickly to Sri Lanka's call for assistance by sending a consignment of relief supply by an special air craft.

Army, Navy and Air Force personnel are working round the clock to provide water, food and shelter on a priority basis to all flood victims.

COLOMBO - AT LEAST four baby elephants perished in Sri Lanka's devastating floods which killed 40 people and left a million villagers displaced, an official said on Monday.

Wildlife Conservation director Chandrawansa Pathiraja said the four elephants drowned in the north-central and eastern regions, which were the worst affected after unusually heavy monsoon rains last week.

In the north-central region of Habarana, the carcass of a drowned baby elephant was found last week in a five-metre tree that had been submerged by the flood waters.

'We also found that several wild buffaloes were marooned atop rocky terrain and we sent food for them by boat,' Pathiraja said.

About 30km of electric fences used to keep elephants from straying into villages were destroyed by the floods.

Elephants are considered sacred animals in Sri Lanka, but they increasingly clash with farmers as habitat becomes scarce.

KEONJHAR: Two female wild elephants were found dead in the Telkoi forest range area in Keonjhar district on Wednesday. The carcasses were seized and buried after post-mortem. The pachyderms were electrocuted to death early on Wednesday morning after coming in contact with the 11 kv Telkoi-Padang-Kalihata transmission line. The incident took place near village Budha amba about 70 km from here, when a herd of about 30 elephants were passing near the line. One of the tuskers demolished an electric pillar and got electrocuted.

One of the elephants was 30 years old and 8 feet and 2 inches tall while the other was 22 years old and 7 feet and six inches tall. One of them got a head injury while the other had its trunk wounded.

Regional CCF of Rourkela Subhas Chandra Swain, DFO Sarat Kumar Mohanty, superintendent engineer of Nesco Niramal Das, ACF Keonjhar Soumyak Samantra went to the spot immediately after receiving information about the incident.

Sources said power supply in Telkoi forest range area was cut off every day from ten pm to six am to avoid accident due to electric shocks since last August. Still, such accidents continue to happen. Earlier in July 31, three jumbos were electrocuted to death in Telkoi forest range area. During the last 11 years 25 elephants have died in the district due to electrocution.

Following the incident, two employees of Nesco were arrested by the forest department under section 9 (hunting), 52 (abetment to hunting) and 58 (negligence) of wild life protection act-1972 and sent to court on Thursday. They were identified as S Mohanty, junior engineer and Indramani Biswal, a line man of telkoi. Employees of Nesco protested against the arrest by wearing black badges. They said there was no proper investigation into the matter and the arrests were unjustified because they were not responsible for the establishment of electric poles or drawing of electric wires.

COIMBATORE: A tusker, estimated to be of 18 years age, was found dead with bullet wounds in Ennamangalam area of Andhiyur forests. Though the animal was killed 10 days ago, the body was spotted only on Sunday. This is the second elephant to be killed by poachers in the last two months.

After the killing of Veerappan, who is said have gunned down at least 100 elephants, there was a brief lull in poaching activities in the jungles that stretch from Sathyamangalam to Erode. That changed in 2007 when two tuskers were shot dead in Sathyamangalam forests. Since then, poachers have killed seven elephants.

Nearly 1,250 elephants are estimated to roam the Erode-Sathyamangalam forests spread over 2000 sq km. Poachers have periodically targeted the tusker population here.

""It is a cause for concern. We have formed special teams to nab the poachers. We will certainly step up vigil to protect the elephants,"" A Arun, conservator of forests (Erode district), told TOI.

Just about a year ago, poachers had killed a 14-year-old elephant in the Ennamangalam area of the Andhiyur forests. Forest officials say the jungles of western Tamil Nadu are too vast and they have few personnel to guard these stretches. ""For the Ennamangalam beat spread over 3,000 hectares, we have just one forest guard and a watcher. How can the two of them keep away poachers from such vast jungles?"" asks a forest department official. ""The Andhiyur forest range has to be bifurcated,"" he adds.

The Sathyamangalam forest division, which spans 1,450 sq km, has just five forest ranges while the 320 sq km Mudumalai sanctuary too has just as many ranges. ""The huge forest ranges should be divided and additional personnel should be posted,"" says a wildlife activist in Sathyamangalam. In the last four years, four young elephants have been killed in the Sathyamangalam jungles alone.

An elephant was found dead by locals and regional officials in a forested area near West Bengal's Jalpaiguri district on Sunday.

No signs of any external injury were found in the preliminary examination conducted by experts.

""We have not been able to ascertain the reason behind the death of this elephant. That can only be found after a post mortem,"" said Subhash Chandra Ghosh, a forest ranger.

Experts have repeatedly opined that massive deforestation, poaching and people encroaching upon forest corridors have forced the elephants to move out of their natural habitats in search of food and water.

India has over 50 per cent of Asiatic elephants, considered to be among the most intelligent animals, but their population has dwindled in recent years.

With the mysterious death of four elephants in the last three months in West Midnapore district, the forest department has constituted an inquiry committee to look into the reasons for their death.

The fourth death of an adult tusker was reported today at Dadra village under Keshiary police station. The elephant was found dead near a paddy field in the village with no external injury marks.
The postmortem of the elephant was being conducted till late in the evening and the forest officials said that they will preserve samples of the viscera of the animal for further investigation.

â€œWe are surprised at the deaths. In each case the bodies of the elephants were found with no external injury marks near crop fields,â€ said Milan Kanti Mondal, Divisional Forest Officer, Kharagpur division.
Mondal, who was present at the site of the incident when contacted, said that he has constituted an inquiry team headed by Additional DFO of the Kharagpur division with various forest range officers of the area. The report of the inquiry committee is expected within a fortnight, Mondal said.

Forest officials said that a possibility of man-animal conflict cannot be ruled out in this case. There have been incidents of elephants destroying crop and attacking villagers in these areas, they said.

The earlier three deaths were reported from Nayagram village of West Midnapore district.

After the incident of seven elephants being mowed down by a train in North Bengal on September 22, the cases of mysterious deaths of the animal have puzzled forest officials.

Another wild elephant died of gunshot injuries despite attempts by the Sri Lanka Army and the Wildlife Conservation Officers to save its life. The injured jumbo with serious gunshot injuries was lying in a shrub jungle in Panama on the boundary of the Kudumbigala National Park when the Wildlife Conservation Officials went to the aid of the stricken elephant and provided treatment with the help of the Sri Lanka Army. The officials said the elephant had a serious injury in the throat caused by an explosive device called â€˜Hakka Patasâ€™ and gunshot injuries in the legs. The well grown male elephant was about 20 years of age and 8ft tall. Veterinary surgeon of the Ampara Wildlife Conservation Office Dr Pramuditha Devasurendra performed the postmortem examination. He said two wild elephants in Ampara Wildlife Range died of gunshot injuries during the last week.

BHUBANESWAR: In yet another incident of mass killing of elephants, Simlipal forest on Monday reported the death of three jumbos, all suspected to have been poisoned.

This was the first mass murder of elephants in the Simlipal tiger reserve (STR) area this year. In April 2010, 10 elephants were found dead. Officially, the number was however put at seven. The April massacre had forced the Union ministry of environment and forest to send an expert team for a field study, which later made a series of recommendations to avoid recurrence of such incidents.

Forest department sources said the bodies of the three animals were found within a radius of 200 meters close to Gopinathpur and Andharitota villages, both located inside the forest area. ""We have not yet received the post-mortem reports, but they were suspected to have been poisoned,"" STR field director H S Upadhyaya said. He said forest officials had been pressed into combing the area in search of the culprits. ""All the three elephants are females,"" he pointed out. ""When we reached the spot, blood was oozing from the nostrils of the animals. There was no visible injury marks in the bodies. We suspect they may have died in the last 24 to 36 hours,"" Upadhyaya said. ""All the elephants were healthy, and believed to be below 15 years,"" he added.

Sources said the poisoning was the handiwork of poachers. Though authorities claim Simlipal has about 400 elephants, the actual number could be less than 150, of whom nearly a dozen are males. ""The poachers possibly targeted the tuskers, but the females ate the poisoned food stuff kept on the animal route,"" said an official. ""Simlipal has become a poachers' paradise. Every day hundreds of people enter the forest with guns, bows and arrows and go on killing the animals. On Monday, the forest officials upon my frantic phone calls intercepted a group of nearly 400 poachers at Kulipal near Jenabil. The poachers had planned to stay in the forest for the night before launching mass killings on Tuesday,"" said Bhanumitra Acharya, an environmentalist, who was instrumental in discovering the April killings of elephants. ""There is no protection worth the name put in place. If the present trend continues, Simlipal could completely lose its animal population soon,"" he added.

JAKARTA â€” A rare Sumatran elephant has died in Indonesia after blocking a village street for a week, an official said Sunday.

The female elephant was in a ""weak condition"" after becoming separated from its herd about a week ago in Bengkalis district, Riau province, conservation agency official Adit Gunawan told AFP.

""It was hungry. We gave it food, water and medical attention. We tried our best to nurse it back to health but it wasn't getting better and died on Saturday evening,"" he said.

An autopsy to determine the cause of death is being carried out, he said.

Antara state news agency reported that the elephant, along with her two calves, had been blocking a tarred road near a housing complex since last Monday. The elephant could have been poisoned, the report added.

However Gunawan said there was only one calf, which would be taken to the agency's elephant training centre and ""may be released to the wild again if conditions allow"".

""I don't want to speculate the cause of death until we get the formal autopsy report. It might have died from stress, lack of food or poisoning,"" he said.

There are at most 3,350 Sumatran elephants remaining in the wild, according to the environmental group WWF.

Conflicts between humans and animals are increasing as people encroach on wildlife habitats in Indonesia, an archipelago with some of the world's largest remaining tropical forests.

However it was too late for another majestic elephant.

BALANGIR: A 12 year-old wild elephant died after being electrocuted in Barghat reserve forest under Patnagarh range, about 60 kilometer from here on Thursday afternoon. The incident is reported to have taken place following yesterday's strong wind that caused two electric posts to collapse on the ground in the area.

""Preliminary investigation revealed that the elephant which died in the electric shock might have come out of the reserve forest area and come in contact with live wire lying on the road"", said DFO (Balangir) R K Sahu. He, however said that postmortem only can reveal the exact cause of death. He said it was an old male elephant. Going by the habits, this elephant should be found moving in a herd.

Post mortem of the elephant will be done at the Patnagarh veterinary hospital. After the incident the forest department officials rushed to the spot to take stock.

The three elephants trapped inside the NRL enclosure. Telegraph picture

Jorhat, April 25: Three elephants were injured after they were trapped inside a newly acquired plot of land, walled off by the Numaligarh Refinery Limited in Golaghat district.

The NRL authorities had constructed a 2km wall on one side and erected an electric fencing on the other side of the plot, divisional forest officer of Golaghat, R. Choudhury, said.

â€œThe three elephants entered the plot last night through an opening in the fence and got trapped. All the three elephants were injured after they hit against the wall several times in a bid to get out of the enclosure,â€ the DFO said. The 100-bigha plot falls under an elephant corridor and there is regular movement of elephants in the particular area. â€œWe had cautioned the NRL authorities earlier not to construct the boundary wall because the area falls under the elephant corridor. We had been anticipating such an incident,â€ he added.

After receiving information that the elephants were trapped inside the enclosure, forest personnel arrived at the place early this morning. â€œAfter nearly three hours of struggle, the forest staff managed to send the jumbos back through the same opening through which they had entered the enclosure,â€ Choudhury said.

The DFO said the elephants had come from the Deopahar area, adjacent to National Highway 39, which connects Assam with Nagaland and Manipur.

That particular plot of the land belongs to forest department and has been selected for a proposed reserve forest, he added. â€œWe have no idea as to how NRL authorities acquired that plot of land. We have not received any papers in this regard,â€ he said.

Chowdhury said the forest department has briefed the Golaghat district administration and top forest officials. â€œItâ€™s an illegal construction carried out by the NRL authorities. It is illegal to carry out construction in an important elephant corridor. Herds of elephants from Kaziranga and Nambar reserve forest frequently move in the area,â€ he said.

The forest department had served a written notice to NRL authorities in Januaryasking them not to carry out any construction on this particular plot of land which belongs to the forest department. An official of the NRL, however, said the plot of land was legally acquired by the NRL from Numaligarh tea estate authorities.

Dak Lak Province authorities have incinerated the body of a baby elephant found in Yok Don National Park last Wednesday.
 
Nguyen Con, Yok Don park ranger, said they found the decomposed elephant, weighing around 100 kilograms, at the section No. 290.
 
He said it was a newborn elephant but they couldnâ€™t identify the cause of the death.
 
Con said several herds of wild elephants have recently been near the residential areas in Buon Don District, threatening the crops and safety of local residents.
 
Vietnam had around 2,000 elephants in the mid-90s but the number has plunged to between 70 and 100 because of relentless poaching and deforestation, according to the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment.
 
Nguyen Van Truong, director of Yok Don National Park, said that there have been 219 cases of illegal deforestation within the first four months this year, an increase of 51 more cases than the same period last year.
 
At a meeting with Dak Lak Peopleâ€™s Committee last month, Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development said he was â€œsure that there have been wrongdoings and collusionsâ€ between officials in charge and poachers.
 
Lu Ngoc Cu, chairman of Dak Lak Peopleâ€™s Committee, said that many residents had reported directly to him about ongoing timber poaching. They even tipped him on which forces to bust, because they assumed that some local officials may have colluded with the poachers.

DHENKANAL: A 45-year-old female elephant died after suffering a sunstroke near Dahimala reserve forest under Kapilas forest range in Dhenkanal on Wednesday afternoon. The corpse was sent for post mortem.

According to forest officials, the elephant was found lying on ground near a pond in Dahimala village around 11.30 am. Kapilas range forest officials along with local veterinary surgeons rushed to the spot and poured buckets of water on her. Hundreds of people flocked there and started pouring water for about three hours.

Though the elephant repeatedly tried to stand on its feet, it could not. Later, divisional forest officer Sunil Ku Dalai along with a fire brigade vehicle from Dhenkanal rushed to the spot.

Dalai said doctors had administered three drips and steroid injections. But she did not survive. An hour before its death, forest officials had informed PCCF to provide more medical support to cure the sick elephant, said Dalai.

Locals complained that fire brigade personnel were late in reaching the spot. Officials, in the department, however, denied the charge. ""We tried our best to reach to spot and sprinkle water,"" said Ishaq Mohd, district fire officer. Kapilas forest ranger Suvendu Bhuyan said the elephant was suffering from dehydration as temperature was high in the region for the last five days.

Forest officials admitted that elephants had to travel long distances looking for water as water sources have dried up in the summer.

No habitat development is going on as there is acute funds constraints.

A wild elephant was found dead in a coconut estate at Siraminiadiya in Puttalam.  Wildlife conservation officers who examined the carcass said that the well grown jumbo was about 8ft tall and had been between 23 to 30 years of age. The veterinary surgeon of the North Western Wildlife Zone, Dr Chandana Jayasinghe who performed the postmortem said the jumbo had died of poisoning. He said 45 wild elephants in the North Western Zone had been either shot dead or killed by poisoning over the last five months of this year. He said he found a deadly poison in the stomach contents of the dead animal which was lying in a coconut estate belonging to an Ayurvedic product manufacturing company. The Asst. Wildlife Ranger in Karuwalagaswewa was seeking a court order to arrest the suspects.

The villagers of Attankadawala in Bakamuna have caught a wild elephant wounded from gunshot injuries and are feeding it after informing the wildlife veterinary officers about the wounded elephant.

This village had recently suffered much due to the human-elephant conflict. Seeing the wounded and helpless elephant that was unable to find food and drinking water, the villagers had informed about it to the Angamedilla Wildlife office.

On the request of the villagers, the wildlife officers had caught the wounded elephant and tied it to a tree and handed over the elephant to the villagers to take care of it. Thereafter the villagers have started providing leaves from Jak trees, Kitul and coconut trees as food for the elephant.

The Mahaweli zone veterinary surgeon of the wild life department W.A. Dharmakeerthi is treating the gunshot wounds of the elephant.

The villagers said that they would release the elephant back to the wild once it is healed.

LAKHIMPUR (UP): Three wild elephants, including a calf, were electrocuted when they pulled down an electric pole near Suheli in north Kheri forest division, official sources said today.

The incident occurred last night when a herd of elephants was crossing the area, which is close to Dudhwa Tiger Reserve (DTR), they said.

Apart from the calf, the dead pachyderms include one fully grown male and a female elephant both aged around 30 years.

Local residents informed DTR, north Kheri and power department authorities about the incident.

Range officer (Nighasan) A K Singh told PTI that the elephants came in contact with live cables after they pulled down the electric pole, which led to the electrocution of the three pachyderms.

Herds of wild elephants regularly migrate into Dudhwa Tiger Reserve from adjoining forests in Nepal in search of food and shelter in the park.

These tuskers often sneak into populated areas of Nighasan, Majhgain, Belrayan and Tikonia and destroy crops and human habitations.

KEONJHAR: Poachers' gain is villagers' loss. Failing to distinguish between the fault lines in human civilization, a herd of wild elephants have swung into revenge mode, attacking houses of villagers in the mining-dominated Champua forest range area of Keonjhar district, after poachers killed a male member of the pack.

Villagers of about 27 hamlets surrounding the Kalikaprasad reserve forest area under Champua forest range have been spending sleepless nights since the past few days due to the elephant menace. Two herds of 16 elephants have been creating havoc in the area, particularly a rampaging violent female elephant in the group damaging houses after the death of a male tusker by poachers in neighbouring Jharkhand.

According to forest department sources, the elephants moving in the area had not caused any damage before the fateful night of July 11 when the male elephant was killed by a poisoned jackfruit in Noamundi forest range of West Singhbhum forest division of Jharkhand by poachers, who then looted its tusks. From that day onwards, the female elephant strayed across the Baitarani river to Champua forest range area of Orissa with her herd and has been causing panic among the villagers.

In the last 15 days the elephant herd has destroyed 54 houses in Champua forest range, most affected being the villages of Kainta, Sridhrapur, Rajia, Indraprastha and Daduan. Many families in the region have been rendered homeless and are spending scary nights under trees or temporary sheds.

The herd is taking shelter in the dense cover of the Kalikaprasad reserve forest, spreading over an area of about 1,200 hectors in Champua subdivision, said Champua forest range officer, R A Mishra. ""The elephant group takes shelter in the reserve forest during the day and come out from the forest in the night to raid villages,"" he said. The forest connects to the Seranda reserve forests of Jharkhand. Elephant herds frequenting this route often cross the state borders via Baitarani river.

""Two elephant drive forces with seven forest officials each in two vehicles have been deployed in the area to check the menace. Crackers and lights have also been distributed to the villagers,"" Mishra said.

""We have deployed a forest team to track the elephant herd and to keep them away from the human habitat. We have also paid compensation of about Rs 2 lakh to the victims' families for house damage,"" said Keonjhar DFO S K Mohanty.

It may be mentioned here that forest covers of Joda, Bamebari and Barbil areas of the subdivision have been steadily destroyed due to rampant mining operations in the region. Thousands of acres of dense forests have been destroyed to accommodate hundreds of mining operations in this subdivision in the past few years.

Twenty-two houses were also damaged in the area last year by an elephant herd.

JORHAT: An adult wild elephant was electrocuted in Karbi Anglong district early on Sunday. The elephant was coming out from a nearby reserve forest. According to forest department sources, an electric post fell on the pachyderm when it was coming out of the forest.

""A wild elephant was electrocuted at Tumpeng area under Hamren forest division in the district at around 3.30 am on Sunday. Although the forest staff rushed to the spot, the elephant died before the officials arrived at the spot. Locals said the elephant came out from a nearby forest and tried to enter a human habitation in search of food. But the jumbo accidentally hit an electric post that broke on the impact and fell on it. As a result, the elephant died at the spot,"" said forest range officer Pranab Terron.

He added, ""The elephant was a full-grown adult male animal and it got separated from its herd a few months ago. The lone elephant was roaming areas under Karbi Anglong West forest division for the last few months in search of food.

Elephants frequently come out of the forest and damage several houses in the areas adjacent to the hills.

Another forest officer in the district said, ""A big herd of wild elephants comprising about 30 animals including a few calves have been taking shelter in the forests under Karbi Anglong West forest division for the last few months.""

Last month, a tusker was electrocuted near Hatigarh tea garden in Udalguri district.

Carcasses of four wild elephants, two of them calves, were found in the interior forest areas of Varayadinkokka in the Pachakkanam forest station limits of the Goodrickal forest range in the Ranni forest division on Friday.

Forest Department sources at Pachakkanam said that frequent lightning which had struck the forest tracts on August 17 could have caused the animals' death. Severe burns were found all over the carcass, sources said. They ruled out the possibility of electrocution since no power transmission line was passing through the area.

The carcasses would be burnt in the forests itself after conducting an autopsy on Saturday, official sources said.

The autopsy would be conducted by wildlife veterinary surgeon Sreejith on Saturday, sources said.

DALTONGANJ: A female elephant found dead at the Khairahee waterhole in the Palamu Tiger Circle (PTC) on September 9/10 was poisoned to death. This was the first episode in the PTC where a female elephant had been so brutally poisoned to death, said PTC field director-cum-conservator of PTC S E H Kazmi.

Sources said the viscera of the elephant was sent to the State Forensic Laboratory (SFL) in Ranchi. Its report has reached the Palamu tiger project directorate.

Confirming this, Kazmi said, ""The female elephant was poisoned to death."" According to the SFL report, organo phosphate poison was used to kill this elephant.

Kazmi said the poison was highly deadly and gave tremendous pain and agony to wild animals. ""The female elephant had marks of terrible agony on her body. The survival rate is dismal in such poisoning,"" he said.

The poison could have been mixed in the herbs with mahua and gur. Asked if this casualty of the elephant is the result of the man-animal conflict, Kazmi said, ""Very much. This elephant became a victim of man's animosity.""

Destruction of crop by elephants is very high and the Khairahee waterhole where this elephant was found dead has a huge human population in its vicinity.

The field director said an FIR was to be lodged and all efforts would be made to track the killers of this elephant as this was not the handiwork of just one or two people but a whole group. The project officials are trying to find out the owners/cultivators of fields where paddy was destroyed by the elephant as instant anger and revenge of these people had possibly taken a toll of the female elephant.

""The killing of this elephant is a pre-meditated and planned act of crime against wildlife and the culprit will be punished,"" he said.

Ramnagar (Uttarakhand), Sep.15 (ANI): A 20-year-old elephant was found dead by forest authorities at the Sarpduli Range in the Jim Corbett National Park in Uttarakhand with injuries on his ears and trunk.

The elephant was found dead under mysterious circumstances on Wednesday.

The forest superintendent of the Sarpduli Range, R.

K. Mishra, said they are yet to determine the cause of the death.

""Blood was oozing out from his ear and trunk, so definitely it is an injury. The cause of the injury would be known only after the post mortem report comes,"" said Mishra.

Forest officials said there were no other signs of injury on any other part of the body.

A 40-year-old elephant had died under mysterious circumstances in a farmland in the state a day earlier.

India has over 50 per cent of Asiatic elephants, considered to be among the most intelligent animals, but their population has dwindled in the recent years. In the last ten years, around 30 elephants died due to electrocution in eastern Indian states.

JORHAT: An elephant calf was injured in the Deusur area of Kaziranga National Park after being hit by a bus on NH-37 early on Friday. Forest department officials said the incident took place when a herd of jumbos was crossing the highway.

""Although the other jumbos in the herd crossed the road safely, the calf got hit by the bus and was injured,"" said Burapahar forest range officer I Majid.

He added that they tried to get hold of the injured elephant calf, but other jumbos of the herd posed a hurdle. Animals getting hit by vehicles on NH-37 is nothing new as there are several reports of such incidents in the recent past.

As a part of the national highway falls inside the park, the animals cross the road both during daytime and night.

Last year, an elephant calf and a leopard were knocked down on the highway while the animals were trying to cross the road.

Every monsoon, when floodwaters submerge vast swathes of Kaziranga, the animals cross the road to go to nearby Karbi Anglong hills. During that time, park authorities restrict the speed of vehicles passing through the highway.

KEONJHAR: Forest department employees on Saturday found the body of two adult elephants, one male and one female, from a remote forest in Ghungi village in Banspal block, about 30-km from here. Another elephant was run over by a train in Dhenkanal district.

The 20-year-old male elephant was about 10-foot-tall and the 25-year-old female one close to 9 feet. Officials suspected the death of the elephants was caused by electrocution, as there were burn injuries on the bodies of both. There was no confirmed report, however.

On Saturday morning, some tribals from a remote village, Ghungi, spotted the bodies and informed the forest department. The DFO and the ACF of Keonjhar division went to the spot along with forest officials.

The man-animal conflict has claimed the life of another elephant. A speeding truck on its way from Kerala to Gundlupet in Chamarajnagar ran over a three-month-old calf at Moolehole in the Bandipur Tiger Reserve on Wednesday night.

Even when the matter pertaining to the ban on night traffic on the Bandipur-Mudumalai and Bandipur-Sultan Batheri route is pending before the apex court, and the State Forest Department and its Tamil Nadu counterpart are initiating several measures to prevent animal deaths on the highway, the death of a three-month-old calf has come as a shock to wildlife lovers.

The mishap, which occurred at around 7 pm on Wednesday â€” when the female elephant calf was returning to the forest after slaking its thirst at Moolehole (river) â€”  is one of the worst road kills in the past seven years.

â€œThe mother and calf were crossing the road when the speeding truck heading towards Gundlupet in Karnataka hit the calf. The calf was stuck beneath the vehicle and was dragged for about 50 feet,â€ said a source in the Forest Department.

On a tip-off by a passerby, forest officials stopped all the vehicles at Maddur checkpost and seized the truck. â€œWe checked all the vehicles and identified the truck from the elephant skin and flesh that was stuck on the wheels,â€ he said. Principal Chief Conservator of Forest and Chief Wildlife Warden B K Singh told Deccan Herald that the driver of the truck, Abdul Azeez, a resident of Kozhikode in Kerala, was arrested under the Wildlife Protection Act and produced before the court.

MYSORE/CHAMARAJANAGAR: In a suspected case of poisoning, a 20-year-old elephant died after eating crops that were sprayed with pesticide in Chamarajanagar district on Tuesday.

The pachyderm was found dead in Basavanna's field in Bettadamadalli in Gundlupet police limits. The incident came to light just after the dawn break on Tuesday, after the villagers noticed the massive animal lying unconscious. The landlord is said to be absconding.

Authorities suspect the elephant died after eating maize and tomato sprayed with pesticides to kill pests. The elephant may have strayed into the field the previous night in search of food. The officers are also investigating if the animal came in contact with a live electric wire nearby.

Meanwhile, forest authorities have filed a case against Basavanna holding him responsible for the death of the wild animal. Police have booked the landlord under the IPC, Indian Electricity Act and Wildlife Protection Act.

Three years ago, around four elephants died after eating crops sprayed with pesticides in Mysore.

MIDNAPORE: An elephant was electrocuted on Tuesday by a high-tension wire that lay on a paddy field at Madnapur village in West Midnapore.

The five-year-old calf had entered the field with a herd of 25 elephants when it stepped on the wire. The calf was instantly killed by the electrocution. A local farmer, who had laid the wire to hook power for a water pump, was booked by the forest department.

""A post mortem has been conducted and the report will be available shortly. The herd came from the Mayurjharna forest of Jharkhand and has moved to the Ausbadi forest now,"" said Rabindranath Saha, DFO, Rupnarayan division. The herd is believed to have around 25 elephants.

Jumbo deaths, resulting from human callousness, have increased in the recent past. Ever since the narrow guage railway tracks in the Dooars were converted to broad guage in 2002, several elephants have been killed. Seven elephants were mowed down by a goods train on the tracks of Banerhat in north Bengal on September 22, 2010. Following this incident, Union minister for environment Jairam Ramesh said that night running of freight and non-stop express trains should be stopped between New Jalpaiguri and Alipurduar. He was appalled at the insensitivity of the engine driver who did not stop after having killed one elephant and went on to kill six more. Ramesh also took up the issue with Mamata Banerjee, the then railway minister. But Banerjee while presenting the 2011-12 rail budget kept silent on measures to curb jumbo deaths on tracks.

BARIPADA: Three elephants, one tusker, one calf and an adult female, were killed in Simlipal. The pair of tusks were missing pointing to the fact that it was the handiwork of the ivory traders. The carcasses were found near Kaleitunda of Karanjia territorial forest division.

Information reaching here on Friday night said ivory smugglers operating in Simlipal had poisoned the pachyderms. Villagers suspect that five elephants might have been killed by the poachers. Field director of Simlipal Tiger Reserve (STR) Anup Kumar Nayak said officials had been dispatched to Simlipal to take stock of the situation.

Wildlife buffs have expressed concern over poachers being active in Simlipal once again. Last year, about 10 elephants were found killed in Similipal. The National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) had also expressed concern over the mass killing of elephants in Simlipal.

In another development, a herd of elephant from Jharkhand's Dalma elephant sanctuary has arrived on the borders of West Bengal close to Deuli forest range of Mayurbhanj district. Exactly a year ago on November 8, 2010, this herd from Dalma had sneaked into Mayurbhanj, causing depredations, damaging standing crops and killing two tribals, divisional forest officer of Baripada B K Panda said. Panda said he has instructed all range officers of Mayurbhanj to create awareness among the border villagers to avert man-elephant conflict when the herd sneaks into Mayurbhanj.

Bargarh, Dec 7 (ANI): Forest officials and villagers in Bargarh District of Orissa have rescued a five-month-old male elephant calf from a forest area after it had wandered off from its herd on Tuesday.

The Forest officials quickly swung into action after villagers informed them about the calf which they found abandoned in the Bhatli forest range and brought him to a nursery.

""We rescued the male elephant calf from near the Bhatli village of Bargarh district. Then we took him to a nursery,"" said Anadi Charan Dash, a forest ranger.

fficials pointed out that the calf might belong to a pair of elephants that were found dead on November 18 in the same forest.

Two elephants, one male and one female were found dead. It was suspected that they were killed by the hunters.

Villagers are flocking to the nursery to get a glimpse of the baby elephant.

Experts have repeatedly opined that massive deforestation, poaching and encroachment in forest corridors have forced elephants to move out of their natural habitats in search of food and water.

India has over 50 percent of the world's Asiatic elephant population. But their number has dwindled in recent years.

One of the wild elephants of a herd which entered in to the residential area of South division of Chokkanad estate in Munnar fell in to a septic tank and was found dead on Friday morning. The four elephants widely damaged the standing crops in the area and it intruded in to the residential area around 2 a.m. on Friday.

The forest officials with the help of Fire and Rescue Service personnel using an earth remover later removed its carcass and a postmortem was conducted by the veterinary surgeon from the Periyar Tiger Reserve, Sreejith, by the evening.

Munnar Divisional Forest Officer Induchoodan said that the animal died as it fell into the tank in dog position and there was considerable pressure on its abdomen. When an elephant falls in to a tank or well in dog position, it dies within two hours, he said.

According to Mr Induchoodan, there was increased presence of wild elephants in the residential areas in recent times. It was after the traditional path of the wild elephants' to the water sources in Chinnakkanal and Kuttiyar Valley were blocked as the land was allotted there by the government without considering its impact on the wild animals. He said that the Forest Department had objected allotting land on the traditional path of the wild elephants. He said that on Thursday night there was report that a wild elephant entered on the main Munnar- Marayur route blocking the traffic for some time.

BANGKOK â€” Thai wildlife officials on Thursday said body parts from a dead wild elephant found without its tusks, tail and penis were likely destined for restaurants in tourist areas.

The creature, which was discovered in Kaeng Krachan National Park near the Myanmar border in central Thailand on Monday, is believed to have died at the hands of a local gang of poachers.

""They cut its tusks, trunk, sexual organ and tail. Those parts must be sold to the middleman and will be sent to restaurants in the main tourist spots like Phuket, Surat Thani and Hua Hin,"" park head Chaiwat Limlikhitaksorn told AFP.

""There is a team of elephant hunters in this area. They are stateless people who live along Thai-Myanmar border,"" he added.

The wildlife department has found four elephant carcasses killed by poachers in the past three years.

Chaiwat blamed ineffective laws for the increase in the crime and putting more than 250 wild elephants and the officers in danger.

Thailand is known as a global hub for the illegal ivory trade, with a dramatic rise in seizures of tusks in recent years as the decimation of the kingdom's elephants has seen poachers turn to Africa for their plunder.

The country has an ivory sculpting tradition dating back to the late 19th century when an estimated 100,000 elephants roamed the kingdom.

Since then most have been lost to poachers and the clearing of their forest habitat, and now just a few thousand remain, many working in the tourism industry.

Benefiting from its location, Thailand exports much of the ivory to China -- where it is traditionally used in medicinal powders -- and Japan.

It was a double tragedy â€“ the bullets not only killed the cow-elephant but also the unborn baby she was carrying at Demaliya, close to the northern boundary of the Lunugamvehera National Park last Wednesday.

Gunned down by a home-made shot-gun, within an area cleared for chena cultivations, when officials of the Department of Wildlife Conservation (DWC) rushed to the area on information received from the villagers , the cow elephant with severe gunshot injuries to the head was already dead, the Sunday Times learns.

The cow elephant was about 25 years old and the foetus about 21 months old, said DWCâ€™s Veterinary Surgeon Dr. Vijitha Perera who performed the post-mortem. When contacted by the Sunday Times, Dr. Perera who covers the Southern and Sabaragamuwa Regions said that if the mother was not killed the baby elephant would have been born in about a month. This was the third baby of the cow-elephant, he added.

Anguished conservationists were strident in their calls for the urgent mitigation of the human-elephant conflict.

Alleged baby jumbo captors give the slip

In another sinister tale, the Sunday Times learns that the DWC has in its custody at its Anuradhapura Office a baby elephant which had allegedly been illegally captured for domestication by still unidentified people who on hearing that the DWC was on their trail abandoned it close to Asirigama in the Palugaswewa area.

When DWC officials set up a cordon, on hearing of the attempt to smuggle the baby elephant from the Asirigama area, the culprits had tied the baby to a tree in the scrub jungle leaving a few water melons by its side, before making good their escape, it is understood.

They may have been planning to come back when the heat was off, a DWC source said, adding that the baby is a female of about one and a half years. It may have been illegally captured by either killing the mother or when it fell into a waterhole in the jungle.

Many conservationists were of the view that the Asirigama area is notorious for alleged attempts to illegally capture baby elephants. The modus operandi seems to be to capture babies and then introduce them as having been born to captive cow-elephants, they said.

PHETCHABURI: Police have issued warrants for the arrest of five national park officials suspected of being involved in elephant poaching in Kaeng Krachan National Park in the province.

Five elephants were recently found shot dead and their carcasses burnt in the   park.   Police   are   investigating whether some state officials are involved in the killings of the elephants.

Chief of Provincial Police Region 7 Sophon Phisutwong Friday said the five wanted on arrest warrants approved by  the  Phetchaburi  provincial  court are Suriyont Photibandit, assistant chief of the national park and four other national park officials â€” Surin Maikaew, Mana Nokkaew, Jinda Phuangmalai and Phol Thomya.

The five have been charged with possession of carcasses of protected wild animals without permission, tampering with evidence and conspiring to hide and  sell  the  carcasses  of  illegally acquired protected animals.

Police have also brought a charge of dereliction of duty against Mr Suriyont, the national park's assistant chief, Pol Maj Gen Sophon said.

The officer said investigators have strong evidence implicating the five officials.

Pol Maj Gen Sophon said investigators had decided to seek the arrest warrants after Phuan Thumsap, 58, a local resident at Moo 8 in tambon Huay Sat Yai in Kaeng Krachan district, provided a witness account confirming that the five officials had burnt a carcass of one of the five dead elephants.

Pol Maj Gen Sophon said Mr Phuan told police he found a dead elephant near a water basin in Moo 3 in tambon Padeng on the night of Dec 31 and alerted park officials next morning.

Mr Phuan said the park officials then inspected the carcass. The elephant, aged about 3, had been shot in the neck. Parts of its body, including its tusks, remained intact at the time of inspection, he said.

Mr Phuan said one of the officials then asked him to remove its tusks, but he refused and left the scene.

He then found the park officials were burning the carcass on a pile of tyres.

Damrong Phidej, the director-general of the Department of National Parks, Wildlife and Plant Conservation, said he had ordered the five officials to be transferred pending a police probe.

Mr Damrong said when park officials discover or are alerted about a dead elephant, they are required by department regulations to report it to their superiors to seek approval for any further steps to be taken.

In the case of a dead elephant with tusks, the tusks must be removed and kept as evidence at the department.

Park officials who fail to follow proper procedures, steal or hide tusks or other body parts of an elephant face punishment for violating the law governing the  Department  of  National  Parks, Wildlife and Plant Conservation, Mr Damrong said.

COIMBATORE: The fauna-rich Sathyamangalam forest has witnessed two casualties in the last one week. Two Schedule-1 animals â€” a 30-year-old female wild elephant and an Indian Guar â€” were killed on Hasanur-Mysore National Highway 209 after being hit by speeding vehicles.

The elephant was mowed down by a Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) bus, bound for Mysore from Coimbatore. The elephant was hit when crossing the road.

Earlier in an accident on January 21, an Indian Gaur died after it was hit by a speeding jeep on the Hasanur-Thalavadi route in the same region.

Environmentalists say these are not isolated cases in the Sathyamangalam forest in Erode. Once the den of forest brigand Veerappan, the place is now a habitat for gaurs and elephants.

â€œAround two months ago, a leopard was killed in an accident. Recently, at least four mammals were also killed. This could signal a dangerous trend, as there are plans to convert Sathyamangalam forest into a tiger reserve,â€ a wildlife activist said.

As per the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, any incidents involving Schedule-1 animals should be booked by the Forest Department and the offender should be remanded in custody. No private justice is permitted by the officials. Spot fines are also not permitted by law. However, according to sources, cases have not been booked for both the above-mentioned incidents.

â€œThis violates the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972,â€ said a wildlife conservationist on condition of anonymity.

Wildlife activist N Lakshminarayanan of Wildlife Conservation Society says, â€œThe incidents reinstate the urgent need to install speed controllers on this highway. The National Highways Authority of India cannot continue being apathetic of such gruesome deaths on the road, threatening the very existence of wildlife of the region. Since most of such incidents take place during the night, it is imperative to stop traffic at least for few hours during the night.â€

However, when contacted, Sathyamangalam District Forest Officer N Satheesh said: â€œBoth the cases do not violate the Wildlife Protection Act. In the case of the gaurâ€™s death, the animal had rammed into the Bolero. It is unfortunate. Even the bus that hit the elephant was being driven within the permissible speed limit. The animal was hidden from the visibility behind bamboo shoots.â€

Dhenkanal/Anuppur/Nagaon, Feb 13: With human habitats closing in on the territories of wild animals, clashes between humans and wild animals are now on the increase.

Odisha: A weeping mother elephant  has been guarding her dead calf for more than 24 hours creating an emotional situation near the sugarcane fields  of Mahapada village in Dhenkanal district, Odisha, over 100 km from Bhubaneswar.

As usual, a herd of elephants entered the sugarcane fields on Saturday night and returned to the  nearby forests before  dawn break.  But an  elephant calf was caught  in a lie wire and was electrocuted. 

The female elephant was seen guarding her calf on Sunday morning. 

The mother elephant is not letting anyone  go close to the dead calf. She trumpets loudly and tries to disperse the crowd that tries to go close to her calf.
 
Forest officials are trying to find a way out of the impasse.

SILIGURI: A six-month-old elephant calf was first shot at its hind leg and was later hacked to death after it crossed the Mechi river to enter Nepal on Monday night. The calf, which had raided a maize field with a herd, was attacked by some locals with sharp weapons.

The foresters have identified another injured female elephant from the same herd, which was last located in the forests of Kalabari. The incident took place at Aldangi village in Nepal's Jhapa district. The villagers allegedly opened fire at the herd that had crossed over to Nepal from Kalabari forests in Bengal's Naxalbari area. The herd managed to retreat into the Indian territory except the calf, which fell on the ground and became an easy prey to the villagers.

While talking about the injured pachyderm, DFO of Kurseong, Y T Aden, said: """"We are trying to find the type of injury the female elephant has sustained. It may be a bullet injury or a wound from sharp weapon. We have to treat the animal as early as possible, which is a very difficult task.""""

Foresters fear that there may be more injured elephants in the herd. """"In the past, we have found many elephants with bullet injuries which were shot in Nepal. So, we cannot rule out possibilities of more elephants being injured in Monday night's incident,"""" a forest guard in Kalabari said.

In February, an adult female elephant had suffered bullet injury in Nepal and died in Sukna forest because of septicaemia. The incident took place at Bamandangi village, a small settlement along the Indo-Nepal border in eastern Nepal's Jhapa district. Aldangi village is also close to Bamandangi.

In last four years, eight elephants were killed and 20 were injured after herds entered Nepal. Two other elephants were electrocuted after they came in contact with electric wires, which the villagers of Bamandangi had laid on the banks of Mechi river that flows along the Indo-Nepal border and

works as a natural barrier against elephants trying to enter Nepal.

Elephants from India generally enter Nepal twice a year - during the monsoons and in the November-December, when farmers harvest their second crop of the year. The region is a part of their conventional corridor from Mechi in Nepal to Sankosh in Assam. On their way, they often depredate human habitats in search of food, which sometimes also results in loss of human lives.

According to reports, people in Nepal, living along the Indo-Nepal border areas, consider the animals as 'Indians' and are not ready to suffer. It is therefore, whenever they cross over to Nepal, villagers open fire at the pachyderms and also lay electric wires along the Mechi river.

""""Only the Centre can take up the matter. They should immediately ask Nepal government to take appropriate steps to curb such killings. We are ready to help Nepal forest department, but the thing has to be arranged by Delhi and Kathmandu"""", a senior forest official said.

An elephant calf, merely six months old, was first shot in its hind left leg and when the animal fell down, villagers pounced on it with sharp weapons and hacked it to death. Its fault - it had dared to cross the Mechi River and enter Nepal along with a herd to raid a maize field.

Two elephants died in separate incidents in Siddapur and Thithimathi on Thursday. A 35-year-old wild elephant died near Siddapur on Thursday morning due to electrocution, while another 25-year-old elephant died as a result of fight between the two elephants at Devamachi Forest area at Basavanahalli village in Thithimathi Forest Zone.

According to the localites, the male elephant died at around 5 am after it was electrocuted at a coffee estate belonging to BBTC near Siddhapur. A 11 KV electric wire passes through the coffee estate was hanging low and the pachyderm got electrocuted.

The localites have expressed their anger over the estate owner and the Electricity Board for their negligence which has caused the death of the elephant. They have accused the Forest and Electricity Board for the unscientific methods they have adopted in managing the work which has led to the increased tiff between the human and elephants.

Forest Department Regional Conservator of Forest Puttuswami, Assistant Forest officer Kariyappa, Zonal Forest Officer Gopalkrishna, Chescom Executive Engineer Rangaswamy and others visited the spot.

Both the elephants were buried after conducting post mortem.

BANDA ACEH, Indonesia â€” An official says a second endangered Sumatran elephant has been poisoned in western Indonesia, apparently by villagers trying to protect their crops.

Forestry Ministry official Harmidi says the carcass of the 20-year-old male elephant was discovered Wednesday near a plantation in Aceh province.

Harmidi, who uses only one name, says a group of elephants had been wandering in the area in recent days, roaring and destroying crops.

An 18-year-old female died in Aceh after being poisoned in late April.

As forests disappear, elephants stray into inhabited areas in search of food.

Fewer than 3,000 Sumatran elephants are left in the wild and environmentalists warn that they could be extinct within three decades unless steps are taken to protect them.

Environmentalists say the discovery of another decapitated elephant in Aceh Jaya suggests that ivory poaching in the area was not only still happening, but might be on the rise.

The Indonesian Forum for the Environment (Walhi) urged authorities to do what they can to stop the illegal practice.

â€œIf nothing is done, it will result in the extinction of the protected animal,â€ said T.M. Zulfikar, Walhiâ€™s Aceh executive director.

On the black market, a one-meter-long piece of ivory costs between Rp 250 million and Rp 600 million ($27,000 and $65,000).

Aceh Jaya forest ranger Mukhtar said the male elephant recenly discovered in Pante Kuyun village was poisoned and its body had turned blue. This was the second incident of a poisoned elephant in Aceh Jaya in the past month.

â€œIt was no different than the female elephant that died on April 30 in Krueng Ayon village. This wild animal was poisoned,â€ Mukhtar said of the recent find.

While initial assumptions were that the deaths were due to elephant-human conflicts, the fact that they were decapitated suggested otherwise, said Taf Haikal, an activist from Acehâ€™s Western and Southern Coastal Caucus, .

â€œThe death of the male elephant and its missing ivory are evidence that ivory poaching may be happening not only in Aceh Jaya, but in all Aceh forests,â€ Taf said.

He said that poaching of elephants was not a mainstream activity and that the crime was being committed by a small minority for the purpose of ivory trading.

Taf urged the police, the Natural Resource Conservation Office (BKSDA) and other parties to investigate the death of the Sumatran elephants and to establish whether their deaths are linked to an ivory-trading mafia.

â€œThe death and decapitation of the male elephant was likely caused by poachers,â€ Taf said.

Aceh Jaya District Legislative Council (DPRK) chairman Hasan Ahmad also called on parties to settle the elephant-human conflict within the hinterlands community.

â€œWe hope all parties can overcome the elephant-human conflicts so that the animal can remain protected, and residents can earn a living peacefully,â€ Hasan said.

Hasan said the government has alocated a large sum of money to overcome elephant-human conflict in the Ulu Masen area. The tensions have existed for years, especially in Aceh Jaya.

Taf also urged the government to find a solution to the animal-human conflict in the area.

Guwahati: The death of a female elephant undergoing treatment for paralysis in Assam's Karbi Anglong district Wednesday has again brought to light the human-elephant conflict in the region.

The adult animal was found paralysed May 2 in the compound of a house in Nahorsala village in the northeastern range of Silonijan.

State's forest department officials said the elephant was attacked by villagers after she broke into a house. She, however, fell down in the courtyard, due to posterior paralysis.

The forest officials then secured the area and got together a team of experts, including veterinarians from Guwahati Veterinary College and Wildlife Trust of India (WTI), to treat the elephant. The exact cause of paralysis could not be ascertained.

""""Conflict is a fact of life in areas where people and elephants coexist, especially due to agriculture,"""" said Abhijit Rabha, chief conservator of forests in the Karbi Anglong Autonomous Council.

Karbi Anglong, around 300 km from here, is the largest autonomous district in the northeastern state of Assam.

""""If we don't have contiguous forests, elephants will suffer. If we want elephants to survive, we must keep our forests intact and develop contiguous forest habitats to reduce conflict and promote peaceful coexistence,"""" he said.

""""Circumstantial evidence indicated possibilities of electrocution and gunshot as a retaliatory measure by people, or even an attack by a male elephant that was sighted in the area. However, as the elephant was lying on its right flank, it was not possible to examine and verify the cause of the paralysis,"""" said Anthony Nokso Phangcho, a veterinarian with WTI's Karbi Anglong Conservation Project supported by the Japan Tiger and Elephant Fund.

""""The post-mortem and analysis of tissue samples will be done and may give information on the cause of death,"""" he said.

Between 1999 and 2009, at least 23 people have lost their lives due to human-elephant conflicts in the Silonijan divisional forest range alone in the district. Likewise, 120 such conflicts were reported between 2007 and 2009 here.

Retaliatory attacks on elephants are also often reported, WTI officials said.

Nahorsala village in Silonijan range of Karbi-Anglong is close to the Kalapahar-Doigurung elephant corridor -- one of the 88 corridors listed in the WTI publication 'Right of Passage -- Elephant Corridors of India'.

""""Securing corridors of elephants is the long-term solution to reduce these conflicts. Along with this, we also need to look at improving elephant habitats,"""" said Dilip Deori, an assistant manager with WTI.

Deori is working with the communities and local authorities to secure the Kalapahar-Daigurung corridor as well as the Kaziranga-Karbi Anglong (Panbari) corridor in Assam. """"This is a difficult task (securing the corridor). We work for years to secure one corridor, but that's our only hope as of today,"""" he said.

Jumbo massacre has recurred in Maoist-ridden Simlipal Tiger Reserve (STR) in Odisha with four charred carcasses of elephants being exhumed from the core area of the reserve. A series of jumbo killings were reported in 2010.

The cause of death of these tuskers is said to be poisoning by Thymate â€” a strong pesticide used by farmers. The forest department was caught totally off guard when the local activists and villagers informed them of the incident on Sunday.

There was a yet another case of tusker poisoning last week in STR, taking the recent toll of elephant poaching to 5. A total of 26 elephants have been poached in the reserve since the past two years.

Wildlife Society of Odisha (WSO) member organization of National Board For Wildlife (NBWL) has come out strongly against National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) for its failure to enforce the recommendations of two successive enquiry committees set up to enquire into elephant deaths in 2010 and 2011.

The poachers are said to be a part of floating population crossing over from neighbouring Jharkhand to the bordering reserve.

It was recently that Environment Ministryâ€™s â€œHaathi Mere Saathiâ€ initiative to save elephants had been taken up in the villages in and around Simlipal Tiger Reserve. Bhanumitra Acharya, wildlife activist and core group member of Haathi Mere Saathi along with Sanjukta Basa, Honorary Wildlife warden STR, were the first to report on the recent jumbo killings.

â€œ Four half burnt carcasses of elephants have been dug out from Nawna (S) range, Balikhal beat and Palpala 10 compartment of STR.â€, says Acharya who returned from the forest on Sunday after two days of exhuming operations in the forest. The elephants were found buried in 2-3 feet deep pits at a distance of about 50 feet from the site where they were burnt.

Of these, one was a tusker whose tusks had been poached. The other three happened to be a female elephant along with her two calves. After the forest department was caught completely off guard on the incident, PCCF ordered an enquiry with Acharya, Basa and local forest officials to look into the matter.

â€œIt is but obvious that the range officer had kept the  top reserve officials in the dark and we can not overlook the possibilities of his complicity in the incidentâ€, felt Basa.

The Field Director STR Anup Naik confirmed of the incident. â€œThese elephants have been killed by the use of thymate. Salt lick areas are created by the illicit tree fellers, by pouring the left over solution of fermented rice that they carry with them in the forest for their food. The pesticide is added to a mixture of  scented soap, salt, mustard oil and leaves dug into small pits. The smell of salt not only lures the elephants but even sambars and cheetals are also drawn to these areas when they eventually succumb to the toxic mix, regretted Nayak.

Going by the modus operandi of the poachers Naik mentioned that directions have been given for earmarking all the salt lick areas in the reserve and maintain round the clock vigil, said Naik.

Acharya minced no words saying that such an organized act of poaching is certainly the handiwork of a section of communities who freely cross the Joshipur More at Karanjia Sub-division from where a walk for a couple of kilometers leads to the neighbouring state of Jharkhand.

Naik pleading helplessness in this regard pointed out that the tiger reserve is affected by Maoists. â€œWe can not go for serious raids or crackdowns in the villagesâ€”- as this would further alienate the local communities from usâ€.

Ignoring report on prior killings cost dear: activist

Biswajit Mohanty, secretary WSO, NBWL member put the blame on NTCA for putting aside the recommendations made by two-member committee set up to look into series of jumbo killings in STR in 2010. The committee comprising of Mohanty himself along with Belinda Wright from Wildlife Protection Society of India had in its report amongst other recommendations listed stringent action against field staff for concealment of elephant deaths and destruction of evidence: as the top most priority. â€œBut no action has been taken against these delinquents as yetâ€, lamented Mohanty.

BANDA ACEH, Indonesia â€” An official says a second endangered Sumatran elephant has been poisoned in western Indonesia, apparently by villagers trying to protect their crops.

Forestry Ministry official Harmidi says the carcass of the 20-year-old male elephant was discovered Wednesday near a plantation in Aceh province.

Harmidi, who uses only one name, says a group of elephants had been wandering in the area in recent days, roaring and destroying crops.

An 18-year-old female died in Aceh after being poisoned in late April.

As forests disappear, elephants stray into inhabited areas in search of food.

Fewer than 3,000 Sumatran elephants are left in the wild and environmentalists warn that they could be extinct within three decades unless steps are taken to protect them.

Environmentalists say the discovery of another decapitated elephant in Aceh Jaya suggests that ivory poaching in the area was not only still happening, but might be on the rise.

The Indonesian Forum for the Environment (Walhi) urged authorities to do what they can to stop the illegal practice.

â€œIf nothing is done, it will result in the extinction of the protected animal,â€ said T.M. Zulfikar, Walhiâ€™s Aceh executive director.

On the black market, a one-meter-long piece of ivory costs between Rp 250 million and Rp 600 million ($27,000 and $65,000).

Aceh Jaya forest ranger Mukhtar said the male elephant recenly discovered in Pante Kuyun village was poisoned and its body had turned blue. This was the second incident of a poisoned elephant in Aceh Jaya in the past month.

â€œIt was no different than the female elephant that died on April 30 in Krueng Ayon village. This wild animal was poisoned,â€ Mukhtar said of the recent find.

While initial assumptions were that the deaths were due to elephant-human conflicts, the fact that they were decapitated suggested otherwise, said Taf Haikal, an activist from Acehâ€™s Western and Southern Coastal Caucus, .

â€œThe death of the male elephant and its missing ivory are evidence that ivory poaching may be happening not only in Aceh Jaya, but in all Aceh forests,â€ Taf said.

He said that poaching of elephants was not a mainstream activity and that the crime was being committed by a small minority for the purpose of ivory trading.

Taf urged the police, the Natural Resource Conservation Office (BKSDA) and other parties to investigate the death of the Sumatran elephants and to establish whether their deaths are linked to an ivory-trading mafia.

â€œThe death and decapitation of the male elephant was likely caused by poachers,â€ Taf said.

Aceh Jaya District Legislative Council (DPRK) chairman Hasan Ahmad also called on parties to settle the elephant-human conflict within the hinterlands community.

â€œWe hope all parties can overcome the elephant-human conflicts so that the animal can remain protected, and residents can earn a living peacefully,â€ Hasan said.

Hasan said the government has alocated a large sum of money to overcome elephant-human conflict in the Ulu Masen area. The tensions have existed for years, especially in Aceh Jaya.

Taf also urged the government to find a solution to the animal-human conflict in the area.

(AP) â€” An environmentalist says three endangered Sumatran elephants have been poisoned and found dead within a palm oil plantation in western Indonesia.

Rono Wiranata from the FAKTA nongovernment group said workers at the state-run plantation were believed to have placed the poison on palm fruits. The dead 3- and 5-year-old elephants were found Thursday in two separate locations in East Aceh district.

Wiranata on Friday cited plantation workers in saying more elephants may die from the poison.

Five of the endangered Sumatran elephants have been found poisoned in Aceh province since April.

Fewer than 3,000 Sumatran elephants are left in the wild. Environmentalists say they could be extinct within three decades unless they are protected.

A 50-year-old wild elephant has died from its injuries after it was shot by poachers in a forest near the Salak Phra Wildlife Sanctuary in Kanchanaburi's Bo Phloi district on Sunday night.

A team of veterinarians had been trying to save the elephant's life but it finally died from infections associated with its injuries yesterday morning.

Manot Yindee, assistant dean of the veterinary faculty at Mahidol University's Kanchanaburi campus, said veterinarians will cut open and examine the female elephant's right ankle, which sustained serious gunshot wounds.

He said the pain from the wounds made the animal lose its appetite, worsening its condition.

Dr Manot said the elephant will be buried and monks will be asked to perform funeral rites for it.

Forestry officials of the wildlife sanctuary yesterday filed a complaint asking Bo Phloi district police to find the poachers who killed the elephant.

They also gave the police a bullet retrieved from one of the several wounds on the animal's leg as evidence.

Thirapat Prayoonsit, deputy director-general of the Department of National Parks, Wildlife and Plant Conservation, said more than 4,000 wild elephants live in 61 protected forest areas nationwide.

Wild elephants had raided farmland and fruit orchards at the edge of national parks after their food supplies in the forests ran out, sparking conflicts between humans and the animals, Mr Thirapat said.

Mr Thirapat said rangers will try to keep the animals inside forests to prevent confrontations between farmers and wild elephants.

The measures include erecting electric fences, digging large networks of ditches to stop them crossing into farming land and making noises to scare them back into the forest.

Farmers whose farmland and orchards are damaged by elephants will receive compensation from the elephant food fund set up by the department, he said.

SHILLONG: An elephant that had strayed into Bangladesh from Indian territory in search of food was grievously injured when it was shot at by poachers across the border on the intervening night of Tuesday and Wednesday, officials in the Meghalaya Frontier of the Border Security Force (BSF) said. The wild elephant was reportedly shot by Bangladeshi poachers about 400 yards inside Bangladeshi territory in Mymensingh district after. The hungry elephant had strayed into Jatrakona village in the neighbouring country from the jungles of West Garo Hills.

""""The elephant suffered four bullet injuries and was serious as per last reports. It was also learnt that one of the tusks (incisor) of the elephant has been chopped off by the Bangladeshi poachers,"""" a BSF spokesperson said. He added that that wild elephants from the jungles of Garo Hills often cross the border in search of food.

Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB) has been apprised of the matter by the BSF, which has requested its counterpart to take action against poachers as protection of wildlife is one of their commitment as per an International convention. Elephants from Garo Hills have been known to """"cross over"""" to the neighbouring country not only in search of food but are also lured in by the scent of local brew.

SILIGURI: A six-month-old elephant calf was first shot at its hind leg and was later hacked to death after it crossed the Mechi river to enter Nepal on Monday night. The calf, which had raided a maize field with a herd, was attacked by some locals with sharp weapons.

The foresters have identified another injured female elephant from the same herd, which was last located in the forests of Kalabari. The incident took place at Aldangi village in Nepal's Jhapa district. The villagers allegedly opened fire at the herd that had crossed over to Nepal from Kalabari forests in Bengal's Naxalbari area. The herd managed to retreat into the Indian territory except the calf, which fell on the ground and became an easy prey to the villagers.

While talking about the injured pachyderm, DFO of Kurseong, Y T Aden, said: """"We are trying to find the type of injury the female elephant has sustained. It may be a bullet injury or a wound from sharp weapon. We have to treat the animal as early as possible, which is a very difficult task.""""

Foresters fear that there may be more injured elephants in the herd. """"In the past, we have found many elephants with bullet injuries which were shot in Nepal. So, we cannot rule out possibilities of more elephants being injured in Monday night's incident,"""" a forest guard in Kalabari said.

In February, an adult female elephant had suffered bullet injury in Nepal and died in Sukna forest because of septicaemia. The incident took place at Bamandangi village, a small settlement along the Indo-Nepal border in eastern Nepal's Jhapa district. Aldangi village is also close to Bamandangi.

In last four years, eight elephants were killed and 20 were injured after herds entered Nepal. Two other elephants were electrocuted after they came in contact with electric wires, which the villagers of Bamandangi had laid on the banks of Mechi river that flows along the Indo-Nepal border and

works as a natural barrier against elephants trying to enter Nepal.

Elephants from India generally enter Nepal twice a year - during the monsoons and in the November-December, when farmers harvest their second crop of the year. The region is a part of their conventional corridor from Mechi in Nepal to Sankosh in Assam. On their way, they often depredate human habitats in search of food, which sometimes also results in loss of human lives.

According to reports, people in Nepal, living along the Indo-Nepal border areas, consider the animals as 'Indians' and are not ready to suffer. It is therefore, whenever they cross over to Nepal, villagers open fire at the pachyderms and also lay electric wires along the Mechi river.

""""Only the Centre can take up the matter. They should immediately ask Nepal government to take appropriate steps to curb such killings. We are ready to help Nepal forest department, but the thing has to be arranged by Delhi and Kathmandu"""", a senior forest official said.

An elephant calf, merely six months old, was first shot in its hind left leg and when the animal fell down, villagers pounced on it with sharp weapons and hacked it to death. Its fault - it had dared to cross the Mechi River and enter Nepal along with a herd to raid a maize field.

In spite of the Indian government taking up the issue of attack on elephants from across the India-Nepal border, two elephants have been spotted with bullet injuries in the Kurseong forest division of Darjeeling district in West Bengal, forest officials said on Saturday. The hilly district shares a long boundary with Nepal.

While a male tusker with a bullet injury was tranquillised and administered antibiotics early in the morning, an injured female elephant remained at large in the Kolabari forest.

Forest officials said the animal had been shot in its right forefoot and was being kept under care since it had lost a lot of blood.

â€œWe are taking the help of two â€˜kumkiâ€™ elephants [elephants trained by the forest department] to trace the female elephant, so that the animal can be tranquillised and treated,â€ Shailesh Anand, divisional forest officer of Kurseong forest division, told The Hindu on the phone.

Mr. Anand said that both the animals were part of a herd of pachyderms that crossed into Nepal earlier this year.

He added that there was a possibility of more such injured elephants in the forest.

He said that it was a â€œnatural migratory habit of animals to cross into Nepalâ€ in May and return in August.

Mr. Anand said that since 1999, there had been reports of at least 12 elephants being killed due to bullet injuries sustained after they strayed into Nepal.

The Stateâ€™s Chief Wildlife Warden, S.B. Mondal, said that incidents, where a herd of elephants crossing into Nepal were being shot at, were happening every year.

â€œThe State government has raised the issue with the Ministry of Environment and Forests, and they have requested the Ministry of External Affairs to raise the issue with the government of Nepal,â€ Mr. Mondal said.

He said that after the issue was raised by the Ministry of External Affairs, the Nepal government promised to look into the matter.

Referring to the continuing attack and death of elephants in such incidents, Mr. Mondal said it seemed that the instructions issued by the Nepal government were not percolating down to the grassroots.

A tusker aged between 12 and 15 years was electrocuted at Kelagane village near Baskal at 2 am on Thursday.

The incident occurred when the elephant came in contact with a live electric wire as an electric pole had fallen in the land belonging to Nagarajagowda, resulting in the instant death of the tusker.

Veterinary doctor Dr Hemanth who visited the spot and performed post mortem confirmed the death of the elephant due to electrocution. The Wildlife and Forest Department officers buried the carcass of the animal after taking a pair of tusks into possession. The local women who had arrived at the spot, performed ritual to the dead tusker by offering flowers, coconut and fruits.

The tusker which was normally found in this part of the region since last five months, had perhaps built a bonding with the villagers. The fact that tears rolled down from the eyes of some of the senior citizens watching the dead animal, only reflected it. Kelagane Satish who first informed about the death of the tusker to the Forest and Mescom staff, said that the villagers were saddened due to the elephantâ€™s death as the elephant was mild and never harmed anybody.

â€œIt never destroyed our crop and it was good to us,â€ he said.
The Forest Department staff said that the dead tusker was one among the two tuskers which had arrived at Kote Kere via Chikmagalur. The tusker was mostly moving in Kundur, Saragodu forest regions.

Berhampur: A tusker was allegedly killed by poachers for its tusks in Ganjam district. Forest officials recovered the carcass of a 60-year-old tusker from the dense jungle of Karchuli, near Madhapalli village under Buguda forest range, on Tuesday.

The elephant was electrocuted after the animal got entangled in live electric wires, laid down by suspected poachers in the area, forest officials said. The poachers decamped with a portion of one of the tusks, while another tusk was found intact, they said.

""""We suspect the poachers laid the live electric wires in the area for poaching wild bore. However, the elephant came in contact with the live wire and was killed,"""" said divisional forest officer (DFO), Ghumusara (south), R Ch Sethi. Forest officials recovered the wires along with the tusks of the animal. The carcass was sent for a postmortem. No one has been arrested in this connection yet, the DFO said.

The incident occurred just a day after the forest department announced reward for tip-offs about plans of poaching through electrocution in the district. At least three elephants died of electrocution recently in Ghumusara, north division in the district, while at least eight mammals, including wild bore, barking deer and sambar have been killed in the region in the span of a year when they came in contact with live wires laid down by poachers, sources said.

It was the second such incident in the district in two days following the electrocution of two elephants and a wild boar in the Karadabani jungle in Gallery range of Bhanjanagar area on Saturday. A total of four elephants have been electrocuted in two days and at a time when the Government and social organisations are observing the Wildlife Week across the State.

According to sources, some persons of Kankhai and nearby villages under Rambha police station were trying to bury the electrocuted bodies of the elephants - one 20-year-old mother with her 3-year-old calf, early morning on Sunday. On a tip-off, the forest officials of Khallikote range reached the spot and recovered the bodies of the two elephants but failed to arrest the culprits. The poachers had buried the body of the mother elephant by digging a patch of land in the jungle while the body of the calf was thrown near a dense bush, only 100 metres away from the mother elephant, forest officials said.

Brahmapur DFO SS Mishra, Khallikote ranger Bijay Kumar Hota and other officials of the division who rushed to the spot started inquiry into the tragic incident. The two were trapped in live electric wire spread in the jungle to hunt wild animals, Ranger Hota said.

â€œWe have to use modern technology like circuit breaker to check the problem. We request the people to refrain from these activities. The people who will give information about the poachers will be suitably rewarded,â€ said PCCF (Wildlife) JD Sharma.

In recent times seven elephants, including these two, have died in the Khallikote forest range, while four elephants have died in the Ghumusar forest division almost in similar circumstances and only seven elephants are left, sources said. A few days back, the poachers took away the teeth of an elephant after killing the animal in the Buguda forest range in the district. At the State-level, 58 elephants were electrocuted out of 282 elephants that died between 2008 and 2012.

An elephant drowned in a DVC canal today in Bankura district where a herd of about 120 pachyderms from Dalma range had gone to drink water.

Three elephants fell into the canal at Dhansimla in Sonamukhi area and were stranded, Divisional Forest Officer Kunal Divel said.

With the help of the local people and forest department personnel, two of the three elephants managed to get out of the water but the third one drowned, Divel said.
The carcass was sent for postmortem, he said, adding that the other two have been taken away for treatment and they will be later released in the jungle.

A female elephant was electrocuted in Dharamjaigarh forest range after the pachyderms came in contact with live electric wire installed to protect a field in village Kudaikela, Dharamjaigarh.

Two persons have been arrested in this connection. Divisional Forest Officer, Dharamajaigarh CL Pandey talking to The Pioneer over phone said a female elephant died after it came in contact with live electric wire installed round a field in the village. The incident happened on Saturday night in Chhal forest range, when the elephant reached near the Kudaikela village in search of fodder. â€œWe have arrested two persons in this connection and have booked under relevant Sections of Wild Life Act,â€ DFO said.

There are about 70 to 80 elephants in Dharamjaigarh range and human-elephant conflicts are a frequent phenomenon. In search of fodder and water, wild elephants often raid the villages situated adjacent to the forests. According to forest department about 150 elephants inhibit in jungles of Chhattisgarh, which has been home to the key stone species for more than two decades. For proper elephant management the State Government has made elephant corridor under the project elephant.

The elephant corridor comprises of Badalkhol sanctuary, Jashpur, Semarsot sanctuary East Surguja and Tamor Pingla North Surguja forest divisions. â€œElephants are no more safe in the state,â€ claims Amalendu Mishra, a film maker and wild life specialist.

(AFP) â€“ 29 minutes ago 

JAKARTA â€” Three critically-endangered Sumatran elephants found dead in Indonesia's Riau province were probably poisoned in a revenge attack by palm oil plantation workers, an official said Monday.

The decomposing carcases of the female elephants, including a year-old baby, were found in a jungly area just outside the Tesso Nilo National Park in Riau province on Saturday, park chief Kupin Simbolon told AFP.

""We believe they died a week earlier, from suspected poisoning,"" he said.

""The elephants probably entered a palm oil plantation and destroyed the huts belonging to workers, who then sought revenge by poisoning them,"" he added.

At least 17 elephants had died this year at the park and surrounding districts, mostly from suspected poisoning, Simbolon said.

""The elephants are protected animals. We must not let this happen again. We are working with the police to hunt down the perpetrators in this latest case,"" he added.

Indonesia is the world's biggest palm oil producer and growing demand has put pressure on the nation's already threatened tropical rain forests.

There are fewer than 3,000 Sumatran elephants remaining in the wild, according to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, a 50 percent drop in numbers since 1985.

International conservation group WWF changed the Sumatran elephant's status from ""endangered"" to ""critically endangered"" in January, largely due to severe habitat loss driven by palm oil and other plantations.

A 35-year-old female elephant was electrocuted after coming in contact with high-tension electric wires in Dhenkanal district in the wee hours of Sunday.

According to Divisional Forest Officer PK Maharatha, the elephant died when she was passing through the corridor in the Mahabir Road Forest Range.

The local people spotted its carcass and informed forest officials, Maharatha said, adding that an inquiry has been ordered into the incident.

According to the locals, some people have used the live electric wires to save their crops from elephants.

They have been complaining about it to forest officials, but no one is responding to them, the villagers added.

Following the electrocution of five elephants and a wild boar in Ganjam district last month, the death of the heritage animal in Dhenkanal district due to electrocution has raised many questions about the safety of the jumbos as at least 69 elephants have been killed in the State in last four months.

An endangered Sumatran elephant was found dead at a recreation park in the Central Java district of Banjarnegara on Wednesday, with park officials speculating that the pachyderm was electrocuted.

The 14-year-old Dona died after she presumably bit a high-voltage wire in her cage at Serulingmas Wildlife Recreation Park.

â€œWhen found, the elephant lay on the floor with her mouth charred. An electrical wire was in her mouth,â€ the Banjarnegara Culture and Tourism Agency chief, Aziz Ahmad, told antaranews.com on Wednesday.

He added that several of the park's enclosures, including Donaâ€™s, were undergoing repairs, leaving some wires that supplied power to welding equipment dangling in the cages.

Dona is thought to have reached one of those wires before biting it, inducing a fatal electric shock.

Elephant tamer Suroyo, 26, who was the first to come across Donaâ€™s dead body, said he was shocked by the incident, having taken care of Dona for the past four years.

â€œDona was a very obedient, always cheerful elephant. Every time we met, Dona always asked to play. I still canâ€™t believe Donaâ€™s gone now,â€ Suroyo said.

Donaâ€™s remains were buried in the park on Wednesday afternoon following an autopsy by police.

Aziz said that with Donaâ€™s death, there remained just one elephant in the park.

Estimates put the number of Sumatran elephants left in the wild at fewer than 3,000, and the species is considered â€œcritically endangeredâ€ by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Conservationists say the remaining population is severely threatened due to habitat loss from illegal logging and palm oil plantationsâ€™ expansion.

PURULIA: Unable to bear the death of the youngest member of their group, a herd of 21 Dalma elephants wreaked havoc in Jhaldah subdivision on Tuesday night. Luckily, there was no loss of life, but farmer Ruidas Singh Mura sustained minor injuries. The jumbos trampled crops and destroyed 10 to 12 acres of land spread over three villages.

It may be recalled that a 16-day-old elephant calf had died on Sunday after it fell into an irrigation well while crossing a paddy field in Durgo village. The mother elephant tried to rescue the calf, but also fell into the well. Though the foresters managed to save the mother on Monday, the calf had already died by then.

Since the last two to three days, the angry mother elephant and the other members of the herd have been roaming in Bondi village, which is about five kilometres away from Durgo. On Wednesday, the bereaved mother hurled farmer Ruidas Singh Mura, who was busy working in the fields, in the air. Mura, a resident of Pahardih village of Baghmundi, has suffered some bruises, but managed to escape the animal's wrath by hiding in a nearby bush.

Forest officials said that even on Monday, the mother had been trumpeting hard and refused to leave the spot without catching a glimpse of the calf. It was very difficult to drive her away and it was only after the elephant left that they could bring out the calf's body and bury it.

Locals said that the herd went on the rampage in Bondih, Joruadih and Ranidih. Talking to TOI, Manik Roy, ranger of Jhaldah, said that the herd was roaming near the Ghoshra Hills on the Jhaldah - Baghmundi border.

""We are keeping an eye on the herd and hope the mother elephant will calm down as days pass by,"" he said, adding that the villagers will be given compensation according to government norms.

A herd of about 21 Dalma elephants, who have been roaming here since middle od September has wrecked havoc of crops and destroyed about ten to 12 acres of land spread over three villages in Jhaldhah sub divison since last night. On Last Sunday, a 15 to 20 day old elephant calf fall into a irrigation well in Durgo village and his mother also jumped to save him. But the calf died and the forest officials helped the mother to jump out and pushed back her along with the rest of the herd.

Since the past few days the angry mother elephant and the other members of the herd has been roaming in the Bondi village area, which is about five kilometres awy from Durgo village. Near Bondi village, the angry mother threw a farmer in the air, Ruidas Singh Mura who was working in the agricultural field. Ruidas, a resident of pahardih village in nearby Baghmundi just managed to escape by hiding in a nearby bush.

Then the herd wrecked havoc and damaged crops in Bondih, Joruadih and Ranidih villages. Talking to the TOI, Manik Roy, ranger of Jhaldah said that at present the herd is roaming near the Ghoshra Hills at the Jhaldah - baghmundi border. "" We are keeping an eye on the herd and hope that slowly the mother elephant will calm down by passing of days and behave normally,""he added. He said that the villagers will get compensation according to government norms.

JORHAT: Two elephants were electrocuted in the Thuramukh area of Golaghat forest range early on Tuesday. Forest staff found the carcasses of the pachyderms at a paddy field in the area.

Forest range officer (Golaghat) Sanjiv Bordoloi said the elephants were found dead after being electrocuted by a live wire passing over a paddy field in the area. ""The jumbos died on the spot,"" he said.

He added, ""Both the elephants were adult males and they went out from the nearby Nambor Reserve Forest to the Thuramukh area in search of food. They also damaged more than 10 houses in the area in the early hours on Tuesday and were on their way back to the forest when the incident took place.""

Last year, another elephant that come from Nambor reserve forest was electrocuted in the same area of the district when the trunk of the elephant accidentally touched a high voltage wire while the animal was passing through the Thuramukh tea garden.

In 2010, forest staff found the carcass of another wild elephant in the Kukurakata Reserve Forest in the Burapahar forest range of Kaziranga National Park after it got electrocuted by touching a high-voltage wire.

""Due to shortage of food in the hills, elephants in large numbers come out of Nambor reserve regularly and visit Thuramukh and its adjacent areas. They damage houses every night to get edibles. More than three persons have died in elephant attacks here this year and many others sustained severe injuries,'' a villager said.

 RANCHI: An elephant which fell into a non-fenced well in the jungles on the border of Rahe and Sonahatu blocks on Wednesday was rescued by officials of the forest department on Thursday. The elephant, which fell into the well, was possibly the baby of one of the two female elephants who were electrocuted at the same place on Wednesday. The elephant was, however, been rescued after about 12 hours at around 2.30pm. The well is not more than 12 feet deep and was lying unused by the villagers. Huge bushes covered the well from all sides and the fact that it existed could not be made out from any side. ""Lack of visibility might have led to the elephant's fall,"" said a forester. There are possibilities that it was searching for its mother. ""The elephant may have come in search of its mother here and was roaming in the jungles when he fell inside the well,"" said Arjun Badaik, assistant conservator of forests Khunti division. The foresters brought an earthmoving machine and rescued it from the well. ""A slope was dug into the well, which helped the elephant come out,"" said Badaik. The  elephant was safe and has returned to the jungles, the forester added. 
A group of 25 elephants, who have deviated from their natural trail, have entered the village and are living in the jungles bordering Kapidih village. ""The foresters came hours after they were informed. The elephants are living in the nearby forests and we are afraid they may come anytime to rescue the baby elephants,"" said Niranjan Mahto, a villager. The villagers have claimed that the elephants, electrocuted on Wednesday, had damaged around 35 acres of potato crops and paddy yield. They had entered the nearby fields and damaged around 25 acres of land on Wednesday after which one fell into the well. Umesh Prasad, deputy mukhiya of Kapidih village said, ""No less than 50 acres of crops have been damaged in the two-day incident."" The elephants are likely to wreak more havoc in the villages because the forest department is not finding trained tribals who can chase the elephants out. ""Owing to Tusu festivals, (the festival is yet to conclude in some parts of Jharkhand and West Bengal) we are not able to find people who can chase away the elephants,"" said A K Mukherjee, ranger of forests Bundu (range).

January 29, 2013 Ten endangered pygmy elephants have been found dead in a reserve in Malaysia, with officials saying they may have been poisoned. The animals, which had all suffered internal bleeding, were found near each other over the space of three weeks. In one instance, a three-month-old calf was found alongside the body of its mother, apparently trying to wake her. Sabah Environmental Minister Masidi Manjun said it was ""a sad day for conservation and Sabah"". Sen Nathan, head veterinarian at the Gunung Rara Forest Reserve in Malaysia's Sabah state on the island of Borneo, said the elephants were all thought to be part of the same family group, and were aged between four and 20. The bodies of four were found last week but then officials found another four animals dead or dying two days later. Laurentius Ambu, Sabah's wildlife department director, said two ""highly decomposed elephant carcasses"" had been found earlier in the year. ""We believe that all the deaths of these elephants are related,"" he said. The animals still had their tusks, indicating that they had not been killed by poachers, and none had gunshot wounds.  There are thought to be fewer than 1,500 Borneo pygmy elephants in the wild. 
Samples have been sent for testing, but Mr Nathan said the damage evident in the elephants' digestive systems had led officials to ""highly suspect"" acute poisoning. Tests will confirm whether they could have been deliberately poisoned. ""It was actually a very sad sight to see all those dead elephants, especially one of the dead females who had a very young calf of about three months old. The calf was trying to wake the dead mother up,"" he said. The WWF estimates that there are fewer than 1,500 Borneo pygmy elephants in the wild, most of them in Sabah state. They are the smallest elephant subspecies, with babyish faces, long tails and straight tusks. They are threatened by logging, hunting and increasing contact with humans. Mr Masidi said the death of ""these majestic and severely endangered Bornean elephants is a great loss to the state"". ""If indeed these poor elephants were maliciously poisoned, I would personally make sure that the culprits would be brought to justice and pay for their crime,"" he said.

January 30, 2013 Kuala Lumpur. Three more endangered Borneo pygmy elephants were found dead Wednesday in Malaysia of suspected poisoning, wildlife officials said, adding to 10 carcasses discovered earlier this month. They may have ingested poison spread by oil palm plantation workers to keep ""pests"" from eating the palm fruit, said Laurentius Ambu, wildlife department director of the Malaysian state of Sabah on Borneo island. He warned that the elephants travel in herds numbering up to dozens and still more carcasses could turn up. ""We are trying to comb more areas. My hunch is that there may be more,"" he told AFP.  ""I don't think it's an accident."" Ambu said three highly decomposed carcasses were found Wednesday in Sabah's remote Gunung Rara Forest Reserve not far from where officials found the 10 other dead pygmy elephants, a rare sub-species of the Asian elephant. State officials Tuesday released photos of the original 10 pachyderms, including a heartbreaking shot of a baby elephant nuzzling its dead mother.The young elephant appears unharmed and has been taken to a wildlife park in the state, Ambu said. A chemists' report on the 10 dead animals would be completed next week and could reveal what killed them, he added. WWF-Malaysia says about 1,200 Borneo pygmy elephants, which are smaller and have more rounded features than full-sized Asian elephants, are estimated to be left in the wild. Activists say deforestation â€” for logging and to clear land for agriculture, especially palm oil plantations â€” severely threaten the habitat of the elephants and other endangered Borneo wildlife. Borneo is a vast island shared by Malaysia, Indonesia and Brunei. Its once-vast rain forests, considered among the world's richest concentrations of biodiversity, are dwindling fast. Wild elephants have steadily been squeezed into smaller forested areas, giving rise to frequent confrontations with humans, but Ambu said the suspected poisoning incident is the first for Sabah. Poisoning is suspected due to severe ulceration and bleeding found in the animals' digestive tracts, he said. Dozens of wildlife officials, police and other personnel have been dispatched to comb through the Gunung Rara reserve for other possible victims.
WWF-Malaysia in a statement blamed the deaths on rampant felling of forests by planters, which had forced elephants ""to find alternative food and space, putting humans and wildlife in direct conflict"". ""The central forest landscape in Sabah needs to be protected totally from conversions,"" said executive director Dionysius S.K. Sharma. It also called for ""frequent and large-scale patrolling"" of forests to protect elephants, but admitted that was a ""massive task"" given the terrain and large areas involved. Palm oil plantations are considered a major threat to rain forests in countries like Malaysia and Indonesia â€” sources of 85 percent of world palm oil supply. Palm oil represents about 35 percent of the global vegetable oil market. But its production is expected to soar due to its versatility, relatively high oil yields and economic importance to local communities.

KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) â€” The WWF conservation group has called for all forest areas in Malaysia's Sabah state to be protected after the remains of another endangered Borneo pygmy elephant suspected to have been poisoned were found. Authorities found the carcass of the elephant late Wednesday, marking the 14th such death this month. The elephants were feared to have been poisoned because they encroached on Malaysian plantations, giving fresh urgency to activists' warnings of rising conflict between man and wildlife as development accelerates. The WWF says the dead elephants were found in areas where forests were being converted for plantations within permanent forest reserves. It called Thursday for full protection of forest land to preserve the pygmy elephants and other endangered wildlife. Some 60 percent of Sabah is under forest cover

A tusker was found killed and its two tusks were removed by poachers at Mahasimana area on Odisha-Jharkhand border at the eastern tip of Sundargarh district. 
 
Forest officials of Bisra range under Rourkela forest division along with forest officer of Samtha range in Jharkhand burnt the carcass on Monday as burying was not possible. 
 
Bisra forest ranger S C Sahani said it appeared the animal was killed by poachers a couple of days ago. â€œThree bullets were pumped into the elephant and upon its death, tusks were removed. 
 
He said the carcass lay on the Odisha- Jharkhand border, touching South Chirubera forest in Sundargarh district. 
 
A case has been registered at Samtha range in Jharkhand.

Two elephants were found dead in diff1TEerent parts of the State on Friday. While an adult cow elephant was found electrocuted to death in the Kosi range of Ramnagar division, a calf less than a year old was found dead in the Bijrani range of Corbett national park. 
 
According to the Corbett national park deputy director Saket Badola, the forest staff heard noise being made by an elephant herd in the Bijrani range of the national park on Friday morning. 
 
The staff visited the site later and found a dead elephant calf in compartment number four of the range. The body of the calf which was estimated to be about 3 to 6 months had no signs of external injuries and prima facie the death appeared to have been caused by natural factors. However, the exact cause of death would be known after the post mortem examination report is received, Badola  added. 
 
In the other incident a cow elephant estimated to be about 20 years, was found dead in the Kosi range of Ramnagar forest division adjoining Corbett. According to the divisional officials, the elephantâ€™s trunk showed signs of electrocution and a hi-tension overhead power line was passing through the area where the body was found. It is believed that the elephant was returning  from the river and its trunk hit the overhead hi-tension power line which was hanging low.

A decomposed carcass of elephant found in the forest area of Rairangpur division in Mayurbhanj district has puzzled the forest officials. While the officials claim that the animal was not killed in the division, wildlife lovers and locals alleged that the elephant was killed by poachers. 
 
A team of forest officials led by Rairangpur DFO Arun Kumar Swain visited the spot inside Tendara reserve forest on Thursday and seized the carcass.  
 
â€œWe suspect that the animal was killed in Jharkhand forest area and its carcass thrown across the border. The animal may have died 10-15 days before. It might be a ploy to mount pressure on forest officials who are on strike since February 22,â€ he said. The villagers, however, said they had heard the noise of tuskers a few days before in the Reserve Forest close to Jharkhand  border. They informed the forest officials on Wednesday after they found the carcass. 
 
DFO said Regional Chief Conservator of Forests (RCCF) Anup Kumar Nayak has been informed about the incident and the carcass sent for forensic test.

National Parks, Wildlife and Plant Conservation department chief Manopat Huamuangkaew visited the park Monday and he was briefed by park chief Chaiwat Limlikhitaksorn. Manopat also visited the scene where the elephant was found. 
 
The autopsy found one rifle bullet and that the elephant had given birth in the past six months. An examination of her teeth determined she was 13 to 15 years old. 
 
Wildlife authorities were collecting additional evidence and the elephant's remains would be burned and sifted in a bid to find more bullet fragments.

CUTTACK: A pregnant elephant was electrocuted at Suniamuha village under Athagarh forest division in the district on Sunday. 
 
The 40-year-old pachyderm, which was in her advanced stages of pregnancy, had entered the premises of a sponge iron unit and died after it came in contact with a high tension live wire. Her 20-month-old foetus also died on the spot. 
 
Forest officials rushed to the spot and started an inquiry. They said the company had not constructed any boundary wall. As a result, the elephant managed to enter the factory premises easily. 
 
""When the elephant entered the factory premises, some electric motors were in use and the pachyderm came in contact with a live wire,"" said divisional forest officer (Athagarh) Arun Mishra. An FIR has been lodged against the owner of the company for negligence. However, the factory owner went into hiding. 
 
""We have sealed the factory and filed an FIR against the factory owner under Wildlife Protection Act,"" said Mishra. Earlier in January, an elephant calf was found dead in Narsinghpur forest. 
 
According to 2012 census, the elephant population in Athagarh forest division stands at 131. Locals have alleged that wild elephants have been moving out of the forests as factory owners have encroached on jumbo corridors. 
 
""In the last two decades, many factories have come up in Athagarh area affecting the habitat of elephants,"" said Sunakar Rout, a senior citizen.",1

In a joint operation, forest officials and paramilitary forces in India's eastern state of West Bengal arrested two poachers and seized 24 lbs. of ivory. 
 
The operation was conducted in Jaldapara National Park in West-Bengal. 
 
On Tuesday forest officials discovered a slain adult elephant with missing tusks in Chipra forest in nearby Buxa Tiger Reserve. 
 
Acting on a tip the joint operation team posed as customers and laid a trap for the poachers. 
 
Five of the seven poachers succeeded in escaping and officials are currently following leads and investigating the matter. 
 
Recently there has been a surge in the demand for Elephant ivory, which is used to treat liver cancer. 
 
Experts have repeatedly said that massive deforestation, poaching and encroachment in forest corridors force the elephants to move out of their natural habitats in search of food and water, making them an easy target. 
 
India has over 50 percent of the world's Asiatic elephant population. But their numbers have been dwindling in recent years.

Poaching scare after jumbo deaths at Hadagarh forest (India)

Keonjhar: After Similipal sanctuary in Mayurbhanj district, poachers now seem to be making inroads into the Hadagarh sanctuary. The fact came to light after wildlife division forest officials seized the carcass of three elephants, allegedly killed by tusk smugglers from Hadagarh wildlife sanctuary near Chakratirtha biodiversity area.



The forest department seized the carcass after interrogating five persons for their alleged involvement in the smuggling of tuskers. The department has seized about 12 kg tusks worth about Rs nine lakh from a house in Purunia village under Hadagarh forest range area on April 22.



The officials found the carcass of three elephants - two male and one female - from Chakraturtha, Kaliamba and Boula areas of Hadagarh reserve forest.



The Hadagarh sanctuary has dense forests and hills, covering an area of about 191 sq km. The sanctuary is connected with Similipal sanctuary of Mayurbhanj district and Kuldiha sanctuary of Balasore district, which is regarded as the elephant corridor. The river Salandi, which flows inside the sanctuary, adds to the beauty of the place. The sanctuary has hundreds of rare species of plants and butterflies. The Hadagarh reserve forest was declared a sanctuary in 1988 for the preservation of elephant and other wild animals, reptiles, rare species plants and trees and medicinal plants.



The objective of creation of this Division is to enforce the Forest Law for a compact area of the Anandapur Civil Sub-Division consisting of Hadagarh Sanctuary, Rebana R.F, and Atei R.F. of the keonjhar District. As these areas are susceptible to theft of timber, the Govt. has taken an effective step by creating Wildlife Forest Division with Headquarter at Anandapur for proper management of the Hadagarh Sanctuary and thereafter creating the Mayurbhanj Elephant Corridor Zone of the Keonjhar district. The office of the Divisional Forest Officer, Keonjhar Wildlife Division Anandapur has four Ranges namely Anandapur Wildlife Range, Hadagrh Wildlife Range, Deogaon Wildlife Range & Brahmanipal Wildlife Range. The total cadre strength of this division is 111. But many forest guard post have lying vacant .



Forest officials said there are 17 elephants in the Hadagarh sanctuary. But because of rampant smuggling of woods, poaching of wild animals and mining activities in the nearby areas have damaged the biodiversity of the Hadagarh sanctuary.



Biranchi Narayan Thakur, the divisional forest officer of Anandpur wildlife division, said, ""The carcasses were seized from different places in the sanctuary. They got to know about the killing of elephants after smugglers were arrested. Investigations are on. We have seized three carcasses from the sanctuary. We are yet to confirm the exact cause of death of the elephants."" Forest officials suspect more poaching activities but are yet to confirm it.

KEONJHAR (Odisha), 28 MAY: A male elephant was shot dead and its two tusks were taken away by poachers in Keonjhar district, forest officials said here today.



The decomposed carcass of the tusker was spotted by villagers near Kachapani under Keonjhar forest division this morning, Assistant Conservator of Forests (ACF) Samyak Samantara said.



The jumbo aged about 23 years was believed to have been killed seven to eight days ago, Mr Samantara said.



On being informed by villagers, forest officials along with vets reached the spot and it was established from preliminary investigation that the animal was shot at its temple leading to its death.



A few days back, elephant poachers had killed a tusker and removed its tusks. However, two tusks were subsequently recovered by forest personnel and five persons were arrested in this connection.

MALAPPURAM: Forest officials on Wednesday morning conducted a detailed autopsy of the tusker found dead inside the  Karulai forest range near Nilambur on Monday but failed to establish the cause of death. The post-mortem examination of the elephant, aged around 45 years, was conducted by forest veterinary surgeon Arun Sakkaria.



The elephant was found dead about three km from Mundakkadavu. Its throat was cut open while there was a deep wound near its left eye.



""The samples of its blood and internal organs have been collected for a detailed chemical examination. They will be sent to the wildlife disease diagnosing laboratory at Wayanad and the results will be available in a week,"" range officer B Harishchandran said. ""The preliminary examination could not confirm the role of poachers. A detailed examination with metal detectors was conducted today but we could not find any bullet in the body.""



He ruled out the possibility of attack by other elephants. ""We believe that the tusker was a loner. The same animal was spotted alone several times in human inhabited areas of Thanippoti, Palankulam and Changaramkode regions. It was a threat to farmers in the region.""



Divisional forest officer, Nilambur (south), C V Rajan was also present during the one-hour postmortem examination.

Despite the efforts made by the forest department to improve protection for the elephants, the Sathyamangalam forests lost seven jumbos in the last two weeks. One of them, aged about 22 years, died due to electrocution in Siddhankuttai on Tuesday.



Though a majority of the elephants died due to natural causes, it highlighted the extent to which the health of elephants was affected due to severe drought.



â€œWe generally witness more elephant deaths during the period of January-May. But this time, the numbers are high. The severe drought, which reduced the availability of food and water sources in the forests, is one of the major reasons for the increasing number of elephant deaths,â€ an official here said.



The severe drought had affected the health of the elephants. Almost all the waterholes in forest areas dried up following the monsoon failure and the elephants, like most of the wild animals, had very little water to drink.



The sickness and infections due to lack of water led to more elephant deaths, environmentalists pointed out.



The drought had also led to a sharp increase in the human-elephant conflicts in Sathyamangalam region this year.



More than 10 persons were killed by the elephants during the last six months and a female elephant was electrocuted while raiding crops in a field.



Conservator of Forests A. Venkatesh said the elephant mortality in the region was under the acceptable levels. â€œIt is not alarming. The mortality is very well under the limit,â€ he said.



â€œExcept one elephant, all others died due to natural causes. We did not witness any poaching or other unnatural events in the recent past,â€ District Forest Officer K. Rajkumar said.



The forest department had taken up measures to create more waterholes and improve the vegetation. â€œWe are taking up all necessary steps to keep the elephants healthy,â€ Mr. Venkatesh said.



The Sathyamangalam jungles is one of the countryâ€™s most important elephant habitats with a very healthy population. According to the census data from the department, the forests are home to at least 1,000 elephants.

A seven-year-old wild elephant in Phetchaburi's Kaeng Krachan National Park was fatally electrocuted by an oil palm plantation's 220-voltage electric fence yesterday.



The incident prompted provincial governor Monthien Thongnit to inspect the scene. He criticised the type of fencing used, saying that it was unnecessary. Petchaburi province has campaigned for elephant conservation and substantial funding has been channelled into taking care of the parkâ€™s elephants and reducing conflicts between the pachyderms and farmers.



Following the 9 am report of the electrocution at Ban Pa Ka Yor in Tambon Pa Teng of Kaeng Krachan district, police rushed to the scene and found the carcass of a male elephant entangled in the fence. The electric fence - erected to prevent elephants to eating the palms in the 25-rai plantation - belonged to Nareunart Ketrat, 50, who admitted to setting up the fence. 



Previously, two cows belonging to a neighbour were also reportedly electrocuted near the same spot. 



The fence is within the Pa Yang Nam Klad Neu-Tai Forest Reserve, which farmers repeatedly encroached upon. However, legal action against encroachment in the area has not been pursued pending the ""right-over-land"" identification in accordance with a Cabinet resolution. 



Despite the resolution prohibiting encroachers from re-selling the land, Nareunart told police that he had recently bought the plot to grow oil palm - a story that was confirmed by a village headman, who acted as a witness to the Bt1.5 million land purchase. 



Nareunart was initially charged with violations of the Wildlife Protection Act 1992 as well as encroaching on the forest reserve.

GUWAHATI: Attacks by wild elephants continue in villages along the India-Bhutan border in Assam's Udalguri district with three people being trampled to death within a week this month and several houses being damaged.



""Almost every day, elephant herds are entering villages and damaging houses and crops. People are scared and worried. Villagers are being attacked and killed by the animals in their desperate attempt to chase away the herds,"" said Ananta Bagh of Green Valley Forest and Wildlife Protection Society, a local NGO.



On Tuesday, Bijoy Tirky was killed by elephants at Saglijhar Basti near Nonaipara Tea Estate. Four days before Tirky's death, Lalmohan Das, another villager, was killed in an elephant attack. On June 19, another person was trampled to death by elephants at Bhuteachang.



Human-elephant conflict is increasing in Udalguri district. Six people have died and an elephant was killed in June. On June 15, the forest department found the body of a 'makhna' (tusk-less male elephant) in a tea garden in the Badlapara area of Udalgiri. Preliminary investigation revealed that the animal was poisoned to death.



With herds of elephants entering human settlements from the hills of Bhutan and adjoining forests almost every day, forest officials are left with little resources to mitigate the conflict.



""It is very difficult to deploy adequate staff at all places as elephants are entering from multiple locations almost every night. Whatever resources we have at our disposal, including 'kunkis' (trained elephants) and firecrackers, are not sufficient to effectively drive out elephants from villages and farmlands at several places,"" a forest official said. Bagh said in many cases, desperate villagers had to chase away the elephants, putting their lives in danger.



""Destruction of forest cover is the reason behind the rise in human-animal conflict. Unless the forest cover is saved, the problem is only going to aggravate in future,"" Bagh added.

The first case is of a three-year-old male calf which fell into a deep drain in Amsoi Tea Estate 

after getting separated from its herd on the Morigaon-Nagaon district border last night. The 

herd was coming from Amsoi hills in Meghalaya. 



The calf was suffocated to death at around 8 A.M. Today as it got buried under loose earth 

which fell on her while her mother tried to rescue it by digging up the ground with her trunk, 

locals said. 



Meanwhile, in Udalguri district, a male adult jumbo was electrocuted at Nalapara in the 

Borangajuli revenue circle in the Indo-Bhutan area. 



The elephant, which had come out of Bornadi Wildlife Sanctuary on the foothills of Himalayas, 

died after it came in contact with high-tension wires, forest officials said. 



There is an allegation that electric transformers kept exposed and electric poles bent down by 

locals so as to harm rampaging wild elephants when they approach human settlements in search 

of food. 



The elephant calf's death in the Assam-Meghalaya border is the third such case in the last two 

months.

Banda Aceh. A male Sumatran elephant aged about 30 found dead in Aceh Jaya district over the weekend is the third wild elephant death in Aceh in three months.



Amon Zamora, head of the Aceh Natural Resources Conservation Agency, said on Sunday that the carcass was found by Ranto Sabon village locals on Saturday morning. He believed a person deliberately killed it using a steel booby trap set using a tree.



â€œItâ€™s very likely that someone killed [the elephant], because the ivory [tusks] had already been removed by the time it was located. We have asked for help from the police to investigate and try to find out who did this,â€ he told the Jakarta Globe.



â€œWe are try i ng hard to capture the individual or individuals who may have killed this elephant for whatever reason, because that is an action that is forbidden by Indonesian law.â€



Armidi, the chief law-enforcement official in the Forestry and Plantation Office of Aceh Jaya district, said the heavy trap had been installed on a fallen tree and angled so that the sharp steel spikes would enter the animalâ€™s head.



â€œBy the time the police arrived at the place where the elephant was found, the trap had already been removed by the [perpetrator],â€ Armidi said.



He added that details regarding the type of implement used to kill the animal had been supplied by people living in the area as well as surmised from marks left on the tree.



Ranto Sabon residents identified the animal as one that had regularly been eating crops planted in the area. They spoke of various unsuccessful attempts to drive it off, including using fireworks.



Armidi said the most recent skirmish with the elephant had been on Friday but that â€œalmost every day that elephant would enter farmsâ€ in the area.



According to Ranto Sabon village chief Amiruddin, the presence of the elephant made residents anxious. â€œPeople have suffered losses [because of the elephant] and thatâ€™s why they put up traps in various locations,â€ he said.



He said that in view of peopleâ€™s substantial losses, he could not stop them, adding that reports to the Conservation Response Unit requesting that the animal be dealt with had not received a response.



CRU is a program of Fauna and Flora International Indonesia that attempts to manage human-elephant conflicts by moving tame elephants into conflict areas.



Amon said humans and elephants were in an ongoing struggle for space in 19 of 23 Aceh districts, with Aceh Jaya, North Aceh, South Aceh, East Aceh, Aceh Singkil, and Pidie among the most conflict-prone areas.



â€œThe conflict is caused by roads used [as corridors] through which the elephants pass while foraging. We have warned the residents several times against [creating obstructions], but theyâ€™re still continuing to do it.â€



Amon said â€œthe population growth for elephants in Aceh is actually pretty good because in a group of elephants there would always be one baby.â€



But he noted that elephants were frequently being killed by farmers seeking to protect their crops, as well as by poachers seeking ivory.



In May, a 10-year-old male elephant was found dead near Bangkeh village in Pidie district.



Two months later a 2-year-old elephant died after living for two months as a â€œpetâ€ for a household in Blang Pante village in North Aceh.



The elephant was reportedly left behind by its mother and captured.



Humans have also clashed with tigers over land further south in Sumatra.

Banda Aceh. Another elephant has been found dead in Aceh, the second this month, with reports from local people indicating that the elephantâ€™s tusks have been removed.



â€œConflicts between elephants and humans often happen in Blang Tualang and the neighboring village of Pante Labu,â€ Rabono Wiranata, the head of non-governmental organization Fakta said on Friday. â€œSome villagers or hunters may have placed poison on the track often used by elephants.â€



The adult male elephant was found on Thursday inside an oil palm plantation run by state-owned PTPN I in Blang Tualang village, East Aceh.



Rabono said the elephant was understood to have died four days ago.



He added that local residents had repeatedly complained about a pack of elephants â€œtrespassingâ€ on their plantations and destroying plants, but there had been no serious response from the local authorities.



The head of Acehâ€™s Natural Resources Conservation Agency (BKSDA), Amon Zamora, said he received a report of the death on Thursday night. A team was dispatched to the area on Friday morning.



â€œBut [the team] havenâ€™t returned, so I donâ€™t know yet as to what caused the elephantâ€™s death,â€ Amon told the Jakarta Globe. â€œIâ€™ve told the team to report the case to police if the tusks were gone. If they were gone, we would strongly suspect that itâ€™s been murdered.â€



The finding came just two weeks after a 30-year-old male elephant was found dead in Ranto Sabon village in the Aceh Jaya district, Its tusks had been severed.



Aceh Jaya Forest Ranger commander Armidi said the elephant died after it was caught in a sharp metal trap placed on a big tree log.



Police and BKSDA Aceh have not been able to find the perpetrators.



The latest finding brought the number of elephant deaths in Aceh to four over the past three months.



On May 9, a 10-year-old male elephant was found dead due to electrocution in Bangkeh village in the Pidie district.



On June 23, a two-year-old elephant died after having been looked after for two months by residents of Blang Pante village in the North Aceh district. The villagers took care of the elephant cub after it was left behind by its pack in a local plantation.



Demand for ivory has soared in recent years, primarily due to increased demand from China, where it is highly valued for its use in crafting ornaments. Elephant tusks sell for several hundred dollars per kilogram.

The Chilika Wildlife Division officials on Thursday arrested two persons in connection with the deliberate electrocution of a 30-year-old tusker in Sipakuda under Rambha Forest range.



Another six, involved in the killing, are still at large and the forest sleuths are out looking for them.



The two were identified as Dasarathi Nahak and Subash Nahak, both natives of Sipakuda. They were involved in removal of the tusks of the elephant after it was electrocuted near a vegetable farm owned by a local family.



â€œWe have identified eight persons in connection with the electrocution including four from one family. They had also made attempts to bury the carcass and contacted an earth mover of Ganjam but he refused to do the work. We hope to nab the rest soon,â€ Divisional Forest Officer of Chilika Wildlife Division BP Acharya said.



Although no tab has been kept on the elephants by Wildlife Wing of the State, what is significant about the tusker is that it might have been among the last of the herd that moved out from the forest of Chandaka and headed towards Ganjam during 2008-2009.



Bizarre as it may sound, the elephants of Chandaka, which have migrated in large groups in past several years, are fast getting wiped out in foreign terrains.



The large herd that went towards Rambha about four years back is feared completely wiped out with the last one being the tusker found electrocuted two days ago.



Till 2005-06, there were about 85 elephants in Chandaka. Now their number ranges between 20 and 30 in the sanctuary and most of them are confined to Bharatpur Reserve Forest that has been engulfed by the Capital City itself.



Chandaka, now rendered an isolated island of a forest, has been facing increasing stress both from outside and within.



â€œWhile an expanding Bhubaneswar and uncontrolled industrialisation in the Cuttack-Athgarh-Dhenkanal belt have been strangulating the forestâ€™s contiguity with the Mahanadi Elephant Reserve, the villages inside the sanctuary have added to the pressure leading to heavy habitat degradation and disturbance and prompting elephant herds to abandon the sanctuary,â€ said wildlife conservationist Aditya Panda.



Under stress inside the protected area, the elephants have headed towards Barbara landscape where they rarely visited. Some headed towards Nayagarah, some went across Mahanadi to mix with Athagarh elephants, while others moved towards Ganjam.



A large herd comprising two groups of 18 elephants left Chandaka four years ago, never to return.



â€œElephants ought to have safe homes and passages. Whenever and wherever the jumbos have gone off their traditional route, the mortality has been high as is the case in Dhenkanal where elephants could not cross Rengali canal and took routes fraught with danger,â€ said Ranjit Kumar Patnaik, a wildlifer.

RAMGARH: A young elephant of 30 years was found dead at Betulkala village under Gola block of Ramgarh district, 35 km from the district headquarters on Thursday.



Senior police officers rushed to the spot and are conducting an inquiry into the death.



A K Singh, divisional forest officer (DFO) of Ramgarh, confirmed the death. He said, ""A young tusker was found dead in Gola forests. The cause of death is yet to be ascertained."" A team of veterinary doctors conducted a postmortem of the dead elephant.



""We are awaiting the postmortem results but initial reports suggest there is no external injury on the body,"" he added. If it turns out to be a case of killing by villagers who face regular attacks by herds of elephants, the forest department will take necessary legal action against them, warned the officer.



Finding the tusker dead, local villagers of Betulkala village informed the forest officers. A crowd assembled at the spot and started offering prayers to the body as they believe that elephants are an incarnation of Lord Ganesha. Some villagers felt this could be an ill-omen.



Meanwhile, forest officers did not rule out the possibility of the tusker being given toxic pesticide. This is not the first time when an elephant was killed in the area.



In all three tuskers were electrocuted near Harubera railway station in Barkakana-Muri rail route of South Eastern Railway (SER) some years ago as this rail route passes through an elephant habitat.

RAIPUR: Elephant menace continues unabated in Raigarh, creating trouble for the people in the region. In yet other incident of elephant attack, a herd of tuskers, nearly 50, polished off crops worth lakhs on Tuesday night in the Junwani area of district.



Blaming the forest department for its slackness and inefficiency, locals alleged that although officials promise to compensate the loss, there are many villagers still, who have been waiting for the compensation for the past two years. Number of tuskers has shot up to 75 in this region. Dharamjaigarh block is the most affected place, reporting incidents of  elephant attack almost everyday. Sajal Kumar, a local activist told TOI that people from at least 30 villages will hold a protest on September 16 in front of the forest department's office. ""More than 1,000 people are expected to hold protest against the forest officials for not taking appropriate steps to prevent elephant attack incidents. We plan to continue the protest till the department takes a significant effort in this regard,"" Sajal said.



He alleged that parts of northern Chhattisgarh face human-elephant conflict mainly because the jumbo lands have been declared as coal blocks and are being allocated to industrialists. ""Hence, the elephants come towards villages in search of food and shelter and create havoc here. But, in spite of elephants being a threat, no measures are being taken to safeguard them. All our complaints go unheard ,"" he said.



Elephant electrocuted: An elephant was electrocuted at Gharghoda in Amlidih. This is third death of elephant in last three months.



Forest officials said that the elephant died due to a high-tension wire was lying near it. Poachers lay current wires to trap elephants while few locals lay wires for self-protection. Officials said that there are at least 200 elephants in the region that are creating problems for the locals.

Hosur (Krishnagiri): Bringing back horrors of the Veerappan reign, the carcass of an eight-year-old tusker was found in the Anchetty reserve forest in Krishnagiri district on Saturday morning, riddled with bullets, its tusks sliced off. Forest officials suspect that the elephant was shot dead by poachers from Karnataka a few days ago. 



Forest bandit Veerappan had ruled over the Sathyamangalam forests in Erode district poaching several hundred elephants for their ivory. But, after the slaying of Veerappan in 2004, there have been few instances, if none at all, of elephants killed for their tusks. 



""We got a tip-off about the elephant death on Saturday morning and visited the spot,"" said Krishnagiri district forest officer A K Ulaganathan. ""The body had been spotted at Yanai Vizhuntha Maduvu in Keratti forest in Anchetty. As it is located deep in the forest, our officials could reach the spot only on Saturday noon,"" the DFO said. The poachers had fired shots at the elephant's forehead, killing it perhaps instantly. ""The poachers could be involved in poaching for many years. This is evident from the manner in which they have sliced off its tusks. It is a clean job,"" Ulaganathan said. 



Based on preliminary investigations, forest officials believe that the poachers could have been from Karnataka. Later, forest veterinarians conducted the post-mortem examination at the spot and buried the carcass in the forest area. 



Suspecting the involvement of local villagers, the DFO has initiated an inquiry. ""Based on information, we have picked up five villagers from Anchetty for questioning,"" said a forest department official on condition of anonymity. As news about the five men being held for questioning spread, about 500 Anchetty villagers laid siege to the forest office in the hamlet. ""Our villagers are innocent and they don't have any links with the poachers,"" said K Pasavappa. The villagers blocked the Anchetty-Hosur state highway for a few hours. Forest officials warned mediapersons against photographing or taking videos of the elephant carcass.

JALPAIGURI: In yet another elephant poaching case in north Bengal this year, carcass of a full-grown jumbo, with its head missing, was found on the outskirts of Neora Valley National Park in the Kalimpong subdivision on Thursday.



The trunk of the elephant was also chopped off and it was found lying close to the body. Foresters patrolling the Sakham area in the Kalimpong subdivision spotted the carcass. This is the third jumbo poaching case in north Bengal this year. Earlier in February, a pachyderm was poached at the Panibari range in Buxa Tiger Reserve and in April, the carcass of a full-grown jumbo was found at the south Raidak range in Buxa with a poison pellet piercing through its body.



The autopsy report revealed that it was a full-grown tusker, which died after sustaining bullet injuries. and the missing of the head clearly indicates that it was taken off to collect the tusks, which fetch hefty amount in international market. The post mortem also revealed that the elephant was shot at which is the reason of its death.



""The elephant might have got trapped in a crossfire on the Assam border where there is a tension over the Bodoland. We suspect that the poachers tracked it at Sakham and chopped off its head for the tusks,"" said chief wildlife warden NC Bahuguna, adding that chances of the elephant being shot at Nepal can't be ruled out too.



Conservationists blamed the department's staff shortage for the incident. In Bengal, the number of sanctioned post for forest guards is 2444, whereas its present strength is only 1573, which implies that the department has a strength shortage by 36%



. Sources said another reason may be the fact that several foresters are now on leave to enjoy the festive season. The poachers, aware of this, are believed to have taken the full opportunity of the situation



""We believe that a large team of poachers is active in north Bengal and is assisted by the outsiders. There have been cases of poaching in Buxa in the recent past. But due to staff shortage, the department has not been able to beef up the vigil,"" said Animesh Basu, coordinator of Himalayan Nature and Adventure Foundation and a member of the state wildlife advisory board.



Earlier, the forest department officials had said that rhino poachers from Assam, who managed to sneak into Bengal, were targeting the elephants here. It is believed that the poachers from north east crossed over to Bengal after the Assam government took up the rhino poaching issue seriously and beefed up the vigil there.



""We have started a probe and are hopeful of nabbing the miscreants soon,"" Bahuguna said.



In what could be a clear case of poaching, foresters on Thursday found a semi-decomposed body of an adult pachyderm at Sakham, on the outskirts of Neora Valley National Park in Kalimpong subdivision. The body had its head chopped off from its body. The trunk of the elephant was also chopped off and it lay by the side of the body.



We are not sure whether the elephant was shot on the Assam where the Bodos are reportedly targeting elephants or in Nepal where elephants are often targeted whenever it depredates into the country. It can be such that the tusker was shot at in Assam or Nepal and poachers tracked the animal at Sakham and chopped off its head for the tusks,"" said NC Bahuguna, principal chief conservator of forests, wild life.

GUWAHATI: An elephant carcass was found by members of a local NGO in the Lebra Santipur area of Subankhata Reserve Forest in Baksa district under the Bodoland Territorial Area Districts (BTAD) on Sunday.



A forest official said the elephant is suspected to have been killed about 15 days ago.



""The elephant might have been killed by ivory smugglers for its tusks, which are missing,"" the official said. Subhankata and the adjoining Dihira Reserve Forest are part of an important elephant corridor that connects Manas National Park to Ripu-Chirang and Barnadi wildlife sanctuaries. The areas are also part of the Ripu-Chirang elephant reserve. Both the reserve forests are under the Dhansiri Forest Division of the BTAD.

SURAT THANI â€• Park officials on Tuesday said they are investigating the death of a wild female elephant believed to have been electrocuted and killed on an orchard near Tai Rom Yen National Park in Kanchanadit district.



The dead elephant was found by the road side adjacent to an orchard around 300 metres from one of the six national parks in Surat Thani province. A team of park officials and veterinarians found a wooden pole wrapped with a 200-Volt electric wire in a shack about five metres from the animal, park chief Pichet Chaisawat said.



Similar wooden poles wrapped with electrical wire were erected around the orchard, creating a fence to ward off wild elephants from trespassing and eating crops.



Anurak Boonchareon, the orchard's owner, said he found the dead elephant in the morning, but denied he put up the electric fence on the premises.



It is estimated that the pachyderm was aged between 25 and 30 and weighed about 1.5 tonnes.



Experts will examine tissue samples, stools and food remains from the elephant's stomach to identify the cause of death, Mr Pichet said, adding that the process would take seven days.

Electrocution of an elephant last week in Tabada-Abthulia forest has exposed the negligence of Forest and Electricity department officials in repairing sagging overhead live electric wires.



Forest department officials and wildlife activists had found the carcass of the elephant in a paddy field in Tabada village on Tuesday.



Villagers said the poachers had laid a trap in the paddy field for hunting wild animals for meat and the elephant might have come in contact with the live wire.



Sources said six elephants have fallen prey to deliberate electrocution in the area in the last three years though officials put the figure at four.



In order to kill the large animals besides wild animals like boars and deer, poachers use sagging 11 KV lines between Jarapara and Tikarpada.



While elephants are killed for tusks, meat of other animals are sold in Angul and nearby villages. Wildlife activists alleged that despite rampant poaching through electrocution, neither the forest nor the electricity department officials have taken any action to set things right.



The sagging overhead live electric wires in the area are yet to be repaired. Wildlife activists alleged that there is no deterrence to stop the offenders.



Following the death of the elephant last week, Forest officials have arrested one Gobardhan Pradhan and are on the look out for four more accused.



An FIR has also been registered by the electricity department against some locals for taking illegal power connection.

A bullet from an 11mm-handgun was found inside the elephant's stomach. the bullet was believed to have pierced the elephant's spleen and one of its lungs. 



The bullet had been lodged in the jumbo's stomach for a long time and could have caused the animal's death, Mr Burachat said. 



The team also found 16 shotgun pellets embedded in the elephant's skin.



The handgun bullet could have been fired by a tourist to scare the animal away, and the shotgun pellets by villagers to stop the elephant damaging their crops, Kaeng Krachan National Park chief Chaiwat Limlikitaksom said on Wednesday.

The jumbos regularly strayed into the adjacent tea estates and villages bordering the sanctuary in search of food and water. 



The sanctuary, with an area of 20-48 sq km, is an ideal habitat for elephants, but over the last decade their population has gone up to over 40 which is forcing the animals to come out of the forest frequently. 



The sanctuary is home to more than 291 species of birds, elephants, leopards, jungle cats, civet cats, mongoose, Chinese pangolins, Indian foxes, sambhar deer, barking deer and Malayan giant squirrels, besides gibbons.

DALTONGANJ: A female elephant is suspected to have been poisoned in the buffer area of Palamu Tiger Reserve. The body was found on Monday and was buried later that day at the same place as dead elephants are not carried on shoulders like human beings. The news of its death was known a day after on the night of December 24.



The body showed no signs of any external injury. There were no gunshot wounds either, said sources.



Confirming the death of the female elephant, Anil K Mishra, DFO buffer area, said PTR officials are awaiting the postmortem report. It is being suspected that the female elephant may have been poisoned as the body bore no sign of any external injury like gun wound, he said.



He added that the place where the body has been discovered is quite close to Kujrum village, where elephants frequently go on a rampage. The female elephant could have become a victim of man-animal conflict. There is no question of poaching since female elephants do not have tusks. Elephants are poached for tusks, he said.



The year 2013 was a rather bad one for elephants in the tiger reserve. Two adult male elephants were found dead under mysterious conditions inside Betla National Park, which is a core area, in October and November.



They remained unattended for two weeks and none of the forest guards, foresters or rangers could get any nauseating odour of the two. When they were discovered, their bodies had decomposed to such an that they were not even fit for postmortem, said field director S E H Kazmi.



None of the elephants in 2013 died by coming under the wheels of the trains here as there is a bridge Jawa, which the elephants cross frequently. The railway lines of the Coal India Chord section pass through the bridge.



Quizzed about the female elephant having died either on December 21 or 22, but its body being discovered only on December 23 followed by burial on the same day, Mishra said: ""Once a female elephant falls on the ground, it is immediately surrounded by other elephants. These elephants do all that it takes to prop up the fallen one. When too many elephants are around, nothing can be done."" Tuskers usually come to the rescue of elephants in distress, but abandon it if it fails to respond to their move, said MIshra.



The DFO said in the event of elephants giving birth, other elephants lay a siege like a protective curtain for the elephant delivering the baby.

A Sumatran elephant relocated by officials from Riauâ€™s Rokan Hulu district to the Minas Elephant Conservation Center as part of efforts to reduce conflicts with local residents died on Wednesday.

â€œWeâ€™re waiting for results of the autopsy to know the cause of death,â€ Zanir, the head of the Riau Natural Resources Conservation Agency (BKSDA), said as quoted by Tempo.

The BKSDA had relocated the 20-year-old female elephant along with two other elephants from Rokan Hulu to the conservation center on Sunday.

According to Zanir, the elephant fell unconscious after being shot with a tranquilizer dart, part of the standard relocation procedure, but denied that she had died because of an overdose of tranquilizer.

â€œUsually elephants would regain consciousness about 15 hours after the shot. But instead, she died,â€ Zanir said. â€œItâ€™s not true [that she overdosed]. We have had years of professional experience in safely capturing elephants.â€

He also said the elephantâ€™s capture and impending relocation was conducted upon the request of the local residents, who wished to minimize the potential for conflict between humans and elephants.

Azwar Habidina, the head of the Minas conservation center, said officials had done their best to resuscitate the elephant and save its life.

â€œDespite our efforts to revive the elephant, it no longer had a pulse and was no longer breathing,â€ Azwar said as quoted by state news agency Antara.

He added that officials were assuming the elephant had been extremely ill and may have suffered from obesity prior to her death.

â€œThis will be something for the Forestry Ministry and the regional government to evaluate and consider; sometimes the evacuation process, despite being aimed at saving [the elephants] and despite all the  precautions, can worsen the animalsâ€™ condition and result in death,â€ Azwar said.

â€œThis case has given us second thoughts about relocating wild elephants living in Rokan Hulu district. We are disappointed by this development.â€

He added that the conservation center had submitted an official report on the incident to the Forestry Ministryâ€™s Directorate General of Forest Protection and Natural Conservation.",1

Feb 4, 2014 CHAMARAJANAGAR / Mysore: Two members of a gang of seven which killed a tusker and removed its tusks were arrested in Chamarajanagar on Monday.  Chamarajanagar SP P Rajendra Prasad said the modus operandi was similar to that of forest brigand Veerappan. ""Nearly a decade after Veerappan was gunned down, we have encountered a case in which miscreants shot dead a tusker and took away its tusks. We arrested two men and are hunting for others."" 
The case was transferred to the Chamarajanagar East police station on January 23, a week after the killing. Officials of the Punajanur forest, a segment of the Biligiriranga Tiger Reserve, found the carcass of a tusker near the Karnataka-Tamil Nadu border on January 19.  Arrested man gave clues to killing
The Chamarajanagar SP said three teams have been formed, to work along with forest officials, to track down the killers of the tusker.  Bedegowda, a tribal, was picked up on suspicion. After two days of questioning, the tribal admitted to killing the tusker and gave cops some clues about his associates. Another person, Mahadeva, was arrested. Following his arrest, the tusks were recovered from the residence of Swamynayaka, who is absconding.  A muzzle-loading rifle was recovered from Bedegowda, a sharp-shooter.  A cop pointed out that Veerappan had killed over 500 elephants over two decades and had removed their tusks in the forests of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. ",2

""We cremated the elephant after conducting an autopsy on Friday. It was about 15-years-old and we suspect the involvement of the ivory mafia behind the killing,"" DFO (Sambalpur) Santosh Joshi said on Friday.

""However, we will confirm the exact time of death after receiving the post-mortem report,"" Joshi added. An elephant was shot dead in Jamenkira range of the district four days ago (January 20) and its tusks were taken away by poachers after dumping the body in Landijharan forest of the range.

 Odisha is fast turning into a graveyard for jumbos with poachers having a free run. The killing of three elephants in Sambalpur in last 10 days has brought to focus the alacrity with which smuggling syndicates are targeting the jumbo habitats of the State even as the Odisha Government seems to be blissfully oblivious to the dangerous trend.
Poachers are adopting new techniques, bringing in advanced arms and ammunition to raid the elephant territories. Using iPhone for GPS support, customising vehicles and even ammunition, the syndicates have taken the forest sleuths by complete surprise. While the poachers are entrenched in the deep forest pockets, mostly Left Wing Extremist (LEW) strangleholds, they have been receiving logistic support from another channel. 
After the three back-to-back poaching in Jamankira and Dhama forest ranges in last 10 days, the Sambalpur South Forest Division cracked down and arrested two persons - Bhagwan Singh and Gupte Dharwa. Singh hailed from Ranchi while Dharwa is a local. The duo, forest officials suspect, was logistics suppliers for the poachers moving in the forests. The Jeep seized from their possession had three step-ins and at least four fuel tanks for carrying reserves in the jungle terrain. There were several pockets in the vehicle to carry essential articles. The vehicle was customised in such a fashion that poachers could shoot in any direction sitting inside the Jeep. There were cushioned points where fire-arms could be placed to facilitate shooting. The forest sleuths also seized at least huge volumes of .303 mm, .22 mm bullets and 12 bore cartridges. â€œThe .303 mm bullets were cross-cut at the tip using Swiss knives so that it could cause grave damage to large animals,â€ Sambalpur Divisional Forest Officer Santosh Joshi said. The accused were also using iPhone for GPS support in the forest areas so that they could track the elephant pockets accurately. Search lights, pickaxes and a host of other equipment which would come handy for removing the tusks were also found. While the incident has brought to fore the swift operation that these syndicates are running, it has also revealed how local poachers are working in tandem with the smugglers. Of six fire-arm licenses that were seized, two turned out to be fake while the rest four - which had expired - were issued in the name of residents of Balangir district. Surprisingly, when the Sambalpur Forest Division sought remand of the two persons to interrogate them about the expanse of the poaching racket, a local court rejected the plea. It is now planning to appeal in a higher court. Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (Wildlife) SS Srivastava has rushed to Dhama and Jamankira ranges to take stock of the situation.

Banda Aceh. Police in Aceh have arrested six people for allegedly killing three Sumatran elephants this year for their tusks, and are still searching for seven other suspects.
The six now in custody were all residents of Teupin Panah village in West Aceh district and were arrested on Saturday for the killing of a male elephant earlier this month, according to Sr. Comr. Gustav Leo, a spokesman for the Aceh Police. â€œUpon further questioning of the six suspects, they admitted they had killed three elephants over the past three months for their tusks,â€ he told the Jakarta Globe on Tuesday.
The two other elephants were killed in Blangpidie in Southwest Aceh district and in Seumantok village in West Aceh, he added. Gustav said the suspects claimed to have killed the elephants by setting up booby traps in which a tripwire tied between trees launched a sharpened wooden stake at the animals, impaling them in the head.
â€œOnce the elephants were dead, they cut off the tusks and sold them to a fence in Kuta Fajar in South Aceh district,â€ he said, adding that police were still hunting down the others involved in the crime. Police have seized parts of the traps as evidence.
Gustav said the alleged perpetrators sold the tusks from each elephant killed for Rp 1 million ($87).
The villagers arrested in the case face charges under the 1990 Natural Resources Conservation Law that could see them sentenced to up to 12 years in prison if convicted. The Sumatran elephant, a critically endangered species, faces mounting threats to its survival from the decimation of Sumatraâ€™s forests to make way for farmland. 
Acehâ€™s forests have largely been left intact as a result of the provinceâ€™s three-decade isolation during an armed insurgency from which it emerged in 2005, but a new zoning plan being pushed by Governor Zaini Abdullah threatens to clear large swaths of forests that are home to elephants, orangutans, tigers and other endangered species. In Riau province to the south, elephants are routinely killed, often by farmers and plantation companies after encroaching onto farmland in search of food. In February, the World Wide Fund for Nature reported that the bodies of seven elephants, likely killed by humans, had been found in Riauâ€™s Tesso Nilo National Park, an ostensibly protected area. The elephants â€” a male, a female and five calves â€” were believed to have died in November of last year, probably after being poisoned, a WWF official said. The findings brought the total number of elephant deaths in Riau in the 10 months to February to 10, nine of which were believed to have been caused by poisoning.",0

  Wildlife officials suspect foul play in the deaths of seven Sumatran elephants on the outskirts of Tesso Nilo National Park. Officials stumbled on the corpses of one female elephant, five young males, and one male calf in mid-February. Although the males had their tusks hacked off, the officials suspect the elephant were poisoned in revenge for disturbing illegal palm oil plantations inside the park. 
""There is an indication that they were poisoned,"" Muhammad Zanir, head of the local wildlife agency, told the AFP. ""Some people may consider the elephants a threat to their palm oil plantations and poison them.""  Sumatran elephants (Elephas maximus sumatranus) are listed as Critically Endangered by the IUCN Red List, with populations decimated by the massive deforestation that has transformed the Indonesian island over the last couple decades. In recent years, Sumatran elephants are also falling victim to mass-poisonings, allegedly undertaken by some palm oil plantations who view the elephants as pests since they can cause heavy damage to the fruit trees.  ""Killing of elephants in and around [Tesso Nilo National Park] has dramatically increased since 2012: a total of 33 elephants have been found dead, many more may have remained undetected,"" reads a statement from Eyes on the Forest, a local NGO. ""If forest loss and elephant killings do not slow down, Tesso Niloâ€™s elephant population might go extinct in less than 10 years.""  Tesso Nilo was established as a national park in 2004, but was already heavily fragmented by thousands of migrants, many of whom have illegal stayed on inside the park. The park is located in Riau province, which has lost some of the most forest on the island. In 1985, Riau was believed to be home to over 1,600 Sumatran elephants, by 2009 only 330 survived. Today, there are likely less.  Eyes on the Forest called on palm oil companies to stop buying fruit produced illegal from inside the park, pointing specifically to Wilmar and Asian Agri based on investigations by WWF.  ""Oil palm plantations already cover millions of hectare in Indonesia, they do not need to be established even inside the few precious wildlife reserves the country has,"" the group wrote. ""Resident palm oil companies are facilitating these killings by providing a market. Without their purchases of the illegally grown oil fruits growers would have no reason to operate inside the national park.""  ",2

DEHRADUN: A day after notorious poacher Sansar Chand died of cancer, carcass of a female elephant was found in Kotdwar range of Lansdowne division and that of a leopard near Binsar wildlife sanctuary. The wildlife officials, however, ruled out the involvement of poachers in both the cases. 

Last week, the body of an elephant was recovered in Chidiyapur range of Rajaji National Park. It was deduced that the elephant had died of electrocution. 

District forest officer of Lansdowne Division Nitesh Tripathi said, ""It seems that the female elephant slipped down from the hillock. She was old and had become thin. She must have died couple of days ago as a large part of her carcass was eaten up by scavengers. The place where her body was spotted was outside the usual patrolling range."" He ruled out the work of a poacher and said they targeted only young tuskers for tusks. 

Tripathi said despite having an amazing sense of direction, wild animals slip and meet terrible accidents, something he came across during his tenure as forest officer at Rajaji National Park. 

In the case of the dead leopard, Govind Kumar, who is a ranger in Basodi near Binsar forest, said, ""The injuries on the leopard's body suggest that it could have been injured by a wild boar with his sharp teeth. It must have happened when the leopard tried to hunt the boar and was attacked by his prey.""

Baby elephant found by its mother's side, in malnourished state 
In a horrific incident in Sri Lanka, some villagers had hidden explosives inside a pumpkin and left it for a wild elephant to consume it.
Wildlife officials in Madhu area found a malnourished baby elephant besides the carcass of its dead mother, which was lying by the side of the road in the village of KK Kulam in Murungan. The female elephant had died on Sunday night. The post mortem conducted on the elephant revealed that she had swallowed a pumpkin, which was stuffed with the explosive 'hakka patas', which is used by villagers to chase away wild animals. The unfortunate elephant had tried to eat the pumpkin which then exploded in her mouth injuring her severely. The official said her jaw had been blown up. This had taken place at least two weeks ago and the elephant along with her calf were in the area, and had been unable to find any food. The mother and her calf were loitering unable to find food and the mother was unable to eat due to her injuries. The calf had been walking behind her without food when it was spotted. The female had eventually succumbed to her injuries and the calf had remained by her side, unable to forage for food on its own. ""The calf was extremely malnourished, with its bones sticking out through its skin. We are currently feeding the baby elephant and he is recovering. We hope to release him to a herd in Udawalawe once he fully recovers,"" Athukorala said.
Wildlife officers say there have been many incidents reported in the area where villagers have been feeding elephants which encroach on their land with 'hakka patas' to get rid of them. However, the officers have not been able to identify the culprits who are directly responsible for such misdeeds. The Department of Wildlife Conservation (DWLC) does not seem to care about the suffering that three elephants are undergoing due to injuries they have sustained, an environmentalist charged.

Banda Aceh. A male Sumatran elephant was found dead in the forest of Teuping Panah Village in West Aceh, allegedly killed for its ivory, officials said on Tuesday.
Head of Acehâ€™s Natural Resources Conservation Agency [BKSDA] Genman Suhefti Hasibuan said members of the agency, along with an elephant handler, had departed to the location to investigate.. â€œBased on reports from a local village chief, the elephant was said to have died a week ago,â€ Genman told the Jakarta Globe on Tuesday. â€œThe team has had difficulty reaching the location, as there are still a herd of elephants [at the location]. We are bringing an elephant handler to drive away the herd.â€ Many scientific reports have claimed that elephants engage in long mourning rituals for their dead, which could be the why the group of animals has remained at the supposed location. To get to the specific area, the team must take a 6-hour long trek into the jungle. Genman said the agency cannot yet confirm how the elephant died, but according to an investigation conducted by local police and testimony from residents around the area, the elephant was murdered for its tusks. â€œIt was initially reported that two elephants were found dead, but the village chief insisted that there was only one,â€ he said. â€œWe will know for sure once the team reaches the location.â€ 
Meanwhile, a local villager claimed the elephantâ€™s tusks were removed with a chainsaw. â€œThere was a trap around a tree,â€ said the resident, who declined to be identified. â€œWe suspect ivory hunters put the trap there.â€ Genman said that this was the provinceâ€™s second recorded elephant death this year; an elephant was killed in February after it was caught in a hog trap set up by locals in Southeast Aceh. â€œIt was not meant to kill the elephant â€” there were hog pests in the plantation area,â€ he said. Elephants living in Aceh have suffered in recent years. Increasing deforestation in the province has resulted in increasing habitat loss and more human and elephant conflicts. Even over the past three months, 20 cases of elephant-related disturbances have been recorded in Aceh. â€œIt takes a group effort involving all parties from the regional administration, BKSDA and local people to handle the conflicts. If not, the conflicts will continue,â€ Genman said. ",1

On Saturday, the villagers electrified the fence as part of the exercise to check the movement of a herd of 8 elephants moving in the forests. One of the tuskers came in contact with the electrified fence and was killed on the spot itself. This was the 18th incident of elephant death in the area in the last one year even as man-animal conflict had been assuming alarming proportion. The area comes under the Dharamjaigarh forest division and had been endowed with rich coal mines that had been the major stumbling block for the solution to the problem. The local residents had been demanding an elephant corridor in the area to prevent the movement of tuskers mostly migrating from adjoining Odisha forests. The villagers in August 2013 held a gram sabha, first of its kind, to register a complaint against ever increasing human-elephant conflict in the area. People from nearly 20 villages demanded a â€œcorridorâ€ for elephants. Interestingly, the administration had come out with an alleged lame excuse that there was no movement of elephants in the area that put the demand for a  corridor under the cold carpet. â€œThe local forest circle declared it [Dharamjaigarh] an elephant-free zone that was baseless and had been aimed to help the corporate to explore rich coal from the area,â€ social activist Sajal Madhu said. An elephant corridor meant no mining in the area that the administration wanted to avoid, he added. The forest officials however denied comment on the issue. They however said action had been taken against the villager who electrocuted the fencing that killed a tusker. Article at the following link:

Prachuap Khiri Khan: Police believe a dead elephant discovered in the Kui Buri National Park last week was deliberately poisoned. 
A bag of white powder was found next to the jumbo. Prachuap Khiri Khan police chief Thanet Sunthonsuk said police gave weight to poisoning as the probable cause. Blood found on the trunk and mouth of the jumbo during an initial examination corroborated this theory. Police believe there is a chance that whoever poisoned the elephant wanted to show off their work by leaving the bag of powder in full view. Fingerprints found on the bag will lead to the identification and arrest of the suspect, said Pol Maj Gen Thanet yesterday. The six-year-old wild male elephant was found dead last Tuesday near Kunchon creek in the park, part of a forest restoration area under a royally initiated project. Experts are certain it died of unnatural causes and are determining what kind of substance the white powder is. Police said the bag looked to have contained a toxic substance and are tracing where the powder could have been bought. Pol Maj Gen Thanet said police have narrowed their search to local shops selling farm chemicals.
However, he maintained it was not yet possible to pinpoint the substance, since more time is needed before laboratory test results are released, insisting investigators are unable to rush the probe.
The wild elephant's death came as some farmers in Kui Buri district filed complaints about wild elephants invading their farms, according to police.
In the past, wild elephants from protected forests have been found foraging for food in pineapple farms, causing extensive damage to crops. Some farmers have put up electric fences to ward off the elephants. Investigators said they need to question more witnesses to ascertain the cause of the latest elephant death. ",1

Four Elephants Killed in 4 Years (India)

By Express News Service

10th May 2014 



Frequent elephant deaths due to poaching has become a cause of concern for Forest officials and wildlife lovers in the district.



In the last four years, as many elephants have been killed by poachers in forest of Dhenkanal-Cuttack and Dhenkanal-Keonjhar border areas. Three of these elephants were killed on Dhenkanal-Badamba-Narasinghpur border and this week, another jumbo died due to lack of timely treatment at Rodanga village near Dhenkanal-Keonjhar border.



According to official reports, a 40-year-old elephant, attacked by poachers in Keonjhar, sustained bullet injuries. The pachyderm bearing 24 injury marks died as Forest officials could not extend timely medical aid. Three days prior to his death on Monday, the elephant had entered Dhenkanal forest range near Rodanga village.



Forest officials headed by DFO PK Sahoo said if their counterparts in Keonjhar had taken appropriate action, the elephant could have survived.



Sources said there are not enough veterinarians to take care of injured elephants even as the district administration has opened an elephant rescue centre at Kapilas here.



Meanwhile, Forest department has arrested three persons recently in connection with elephant poaching case at Hindol on April 19.



On Monday, Narada Pradhan of Rajnag village in Hindol was arrested for his alleged involvement in killing of a tusker. The 25-year-old tusker was killed by four poachers on April 19. They had links with a tusk trader in Kandhar reserve forest under Hindol division. Police said the trader belongs to Narasinghpur and had offered `40,000 to Pradhan to kill an elephant and provide the tusk to him. Subsequently, a tusker was killed and as the news spread, Forest department formed a 15-member team to nab the poachers. On a tip off, they managed to nab Pradhan while three others and the trader remained elusive.



On Thursday, the three remaining poachers were arrested. â€œThere are two masterminds of this poaching racket who would be arrested soon,â€ the DFO said.



Besides, forest guard Prasant Naik has been placed under suspension for not informing his higher authorities about the incident. Similar action has been taken against forester Uddhav Behera and range officer Gatikrushna Mohanty for dereliction of duty in the Kandhar poaching case.

COIMBATORE: Two female elephants battling serious illness and exhaustion for the past few days on the banks of Moyar river, near Bhavanisagar reservoir, died on Friday despite being given medical attention.
""Both the female elephants, one of them in an advanced stage of pregnancy, were affected by hepatitis and intestinal infections. The animals would not have eaten properly for a few months, and became anemic. We tried to save them. But, they could not even stand,"" said K Rajkumar, district forest officer, Sathyamangalam forest division. On May 6, a female elephant aged around 15 years was found lying in the slush near the river bank. Forest officials rushed to the spot and administered medicines, but it could not get up. The next day, an elephant herd went to the river bank, and one of the female elephants, about 25 years old, was later found lying down as it was weak. The forest veterinary doctor N S Manoharan and his team, besides forest officials, visited the bank and treated the pachyderm. ""We tied tapes around the elephants and lifted them with the help of earthmovers. But they were too sick to even stand up. They could not eat food and had intestinal infections,"" said A Sivasubramaniam, range officer of Bhavanisagar forest range. After the autopsy of both the elephants, the two pachyderms and the fetus were buried at the reservoir site. ",1

Jakarta. A wild Sumatran elephant was found dead in a village in Riau,
allegedly hunted and killed for its tusks, according to Antara.

?The elephant was found in a horrible condition, the head was almost
split, and there?s a hole allegedly caused by a gunshot,? Tomy
Simanungkalit, director of of a civil society organization Riau Madani,
was quoted as saying by state-run Antara news agency on Thursday.

Tomy said the elephant was found dead in Lubuk Kembang Bunga village in
Pelalawan district last week. The elephant was part of  a herd from Tesso
Nilo National Park (TNTN).

Riau Natural Resources Conservation Agency (BKSDA) Riau and Pelalawan Baru
Police performed the autopsy on the adult male elephant on Tuesday.

?There?s a strong indication that the perpetrator used an electric
chainsaw to cut off its trunk and its face to get the ivory,? Tomy said.

This case adds to the long list of elephant deaths in Riau due to hunting
and conflict with humans. Forty-five elephants have died in Sumatra since
2012.

GUWAHATI: Panic has gripped villages along the India-Bhutan international
border in Assam's Udalguri district with a jumbo herd attacking humans and
damaging houses regularly.

Four persons were trampled to death by a wild elephant, which also damaged
houses, on Monday night. With this, the toll in elephant attacks in the
district has risen to 10 so far this year. One elephant was also killed.

After sunset, women and children in villages frequented by elephants spend
the night in safe places while men stay back to chase away the jumbos. On
Monday, the four persons killed when they were trying to chase away
elephants at Coramore and Bormukuli areas.

""There is hardly a single day when elephants do not enter villages. In
fact, herds of elephants entering villages have increased this time. It's a
big challenge to prevent the jumbos from entering human settlements,"" said
Dhansiri divisional forest officer G N Adhikari.

According to honorary wildlife warden Jayanta Kumar Das, at least 25
villages in the district are hit by man-elephant conflict. ""The conflict is
taking a serious turn in Udalguri. About 25 villages have been hit by
elephant attacks. Udalguri is one of the worst-hit. Most of human deaths
occur when they try to chase away elephants from their croplands or
villages,"" said Das.

Sources said Udalguri is one of the districts where destruction of forests
and elephant habitat is taking place very fast. ""Illegal tree-felling is
going on. Large swathes of forest tract along the international border in
the district has been cleared and human settlements have come up. These
forest tracts were elephant habitats. Now, elephants are forced to enter
these villages and croplands for fodder,"" said a conservationist.

Forest department officials in Udalguri said they had little resources to
tide over the increasing human-elephant conflict in the district. The
district falls under Bodoland Territorial Area District administration.
""Habitat destruction is the major reason why people are affected by
elephant attacks. The elephants no longer have their safe habitats now. So,
the conflict is intensifying,"" said Ananta Bagh of Green Valley Forest and
Wildlife Protection Society, a local NGO.",1

Ranchi: The gentle giant of Palamau Tiger Reserve (PTR) is no more.
Unidentified poachers shot 50-year-old beloved tusker Ganesh on the
precincts of the national park yesterday, split open his jaw and escaped
with one tusk, his death casting a pall of gloom over the area and making a
mockery of chief minister Hemant Soren’s Van Mahotsav speech on “saving
forests and animals” today.

Lax security at PTR dealt a body blow to Ganesh, the oldest of the eight
tuskers at the reserve, pointing to a possible nexus between poachers from
Chhattisgarh, barely 15-16km away, and trackers looking for easy money from
illegal ivory trade.

The carcass of the magnificent animal was discovered late last night at
BC-6 compartment of the Baresand range of the 1,124sqkm reserve’s buffer
area, one tusk missing. The smaller tusk was untouched. Prima facie, the
animal was felled in daylight.

PTR field director S.E.H. Kazmi has gone to the site to oversee
formalities, including post-mortem. Though details are awaited, sources say
the genial elephant could have been shot at point-blank range.

“Ganesh was not ferocious like other tuskers. He never rampaged homes or
paddy fields. He was mast maula (fun-loving) yet gentle. So, whoever shot
him could have easily done so at point-blank range,” said a veteran
forester.

The obvious challenge before PTR now is to nab the culprits, but so far no
game plan has emerged. “We are on the case and will leave no stone unturned
to nab the culprits,” said principal chief conservator of forests D.K.
Srivastava.

If the poachers are from Chhattisgarh, chances are the tusk will find its
way to Nagpur in Maharashtra or Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh. Most stolen
ivory makes its way to international markets, including Nepal. The network
is cash-rich and well oiled.

Between October and December last year, PTR lost three elephants under
mysterious conditions. In 2012, a leopard was killed but officials managed
to arrest one of the poachers after two months when he was trying to sell
the skin in Satbarwa, near Palamau.

Fifteen years ago, a tiger was killed in PTR and its skin found in
Chhattisgarh, which then was part of its parent state Madhya Pradesh.

As modus operandi, poachers befriend ill-paid trackers, many of whom are
resentful towards authorities for the contractual nature of jobs. These
trackers, enticed by easy money and lacking any reason to be loyal to the
reserve, pass on crucial information on endangered animals to poachers.

But instead of plugging infrastructure and security gaps, subsequent state
governments have mouthed platitudes.

Even today, chief minister Hemant spoke at Van Mahotsav at Morabadi in the
capital on how wildlife was precious and how people should work together
for its conservation.

Wildlife activist D.S. Srivastava, who rushed to Palamau today, blamed the
government for not making endangered animals safe. Recalling his encounters
with Ganesh, he said: “Cool as a cucumber, he was the cynosure of all eyes
at PTR. Tourists across generations loved to see his antics.”",1

SAMBALPUR: Close on the heels of killing of an elephant in Padiabahal range
of Sambalpur forest division, yet another jumbo was found shot dead in the
same area. A forest team recovered the carcass on Friday and cremated it
after conducting autopsy. This is sixth such incident during past six
months. In all cases, ivory mafia took away tusks after gunning down the
pachyderms.

In the latest incident, forest officials recovered the carcass near
Kandaraghat hillock under Jujomora block. It is suspected that the elephant
was killed about a week back and the miscreants left the body after
chopping off the head portion.

Local villagers said they informed the forest officials after spotting the
carcass on Thursday. ""We suspect involvement of ivory mafia in the incident
and have started investigation,"" DFO (Sambalpur) Santosh Kumar Joshi said.
He said a bullet was recovered from the body during autopsy.

Forest officials on Thursday arrested three persons in connection with
killing of another jumbo recently and seized a gun and Rs 72,000 from their
possession. The accused were identified as Yogesh Lugun, 35, Motilal Munda,
25, and Barun Kumar Barua, 29, of Kadelpal village under Sambalpur's
Jamenkira block. They have confessed their involvement in the killing of an
elephant, body of which was recovered from a forest under Padiabahal range
on July 24, said Joshi.

""We could not recover the tusks from the accused as they had already sold
them,"" Joshi added. He said a show-cause notice has been served to range
officer Anil Mohanty while forester Ramesh Padhi and forest guard Rasmi
Ranjan Das were suspended for negligence of duty.",1

MANGALORE: A wild tusker's love for Caryota urens (known as baine in local
parlance), cost its life when it got electrocuted at Herakaje, Devachalla
Village in the Nalkur Reserve Forest of Subrahmanya Range, about 100 kms
from here, on Friday.

Mangalore Divisional Forest Officer (DFO) Palaiah who visited the spot said
the elephant died due to electrocution and it was an accidental death.
There was heavy rain in that area on Thursday and water acted as a
conductor when a tree pushed by the elephant touched the overhead
electrical line,'' said the DFO.

The tusker had entered the plantation of Chinnappa Gowda at around 11pm on
Thursday. Gowda's family, alerted by the constant barking of the dogs,
raised a din and shooed away the pachyderm into the nearby forest. On
Friday morning, Gowda found the carcass of the elephant.

Gowda said: The elephant had come to the plantation twice at 10pm and 11pm.
On Friday I went to check what damage it had done only to find that the
elephant dead. Mescom officials said the electrical line was not sagging
and was at a specific height. The electrocution happened as the tree which
the elephant pushed or touching the lines came in contact with the
pachyderm.

Palaiah said the post mortem is being conducted and the tusks will be
removed by Saturday. The elephant's carcass would be burnt, according to
the rules, he added.

This is not the first time that elephants have visited this area. On
February 12, 2013 a wild elephant was responsible for the death of Hosoli
Rama Bhat, when the farmer had gone to his plantation at night to change a
defective sprinkler. This was about three km from where the pachyderm got
electrocuted.",1

KOTA KINABALU, Aug 18, 2014:
An adult male elephant was found dead with gunshot wounds along a road at
the Felda Umas Oil Plantation, some 70km from Tawau.
Tawau-based Sabah Wildlife Department (SWD) officer Soffian Abu Bakar said
they received a call from the plantation manager last Friday at 9am on the
elephant carcass, believed to be aged between 18 and 25.
He then called on the public to provide them with information on the
elephant shooting, because “a crime has been committed”.
“The team found a small wound on the abdominal area which indicated a
probable entry wound for a bullet,” said SWD assistant director Dr Sen
Nathan.
He said a bullet was found lodged in the elephant’s left lung.
Sen said it had entered the abdominal area and penetrated the intestines,
causing serious internal bleeding and finally hitting the lung.
He added that they believed the elephant had suffered for at least two to
four days before succumbing to its injury.
Sen said the slug has been handed over to the police for further
examination and identification.
“What we see here is an ongoing malady, not only here in Felda Umas, but
also in other parts of Sabah that share its areas with elephant habitats,”
said SWD director Datuk Dr Laurentius Ambu.
He said human-elephant conflicts in Felda Umas had been an ongoing issue
with 15 elephants translocated away from the site to date.
The dead elephant, Ambu revealed, was one of the remaining few awaiting
translocation.
Similar problems, he explained, were found in the Telupid district where
more than 25 elephants had ventured out of the forest habitat and caused
damage to fruit trees and small oil palm plantations owned by villagers.
The herd, Ambu said, had also made its way as close as 1km from Telupid
town.
“We have already translocated eight elephants and are still in the process
of translocating the others.”
Ambu said what was more worrying was that elephants were encroaching areas
where the communities had never seen them in the past, thus creating a
serious elephant-human conflict.
“One of these areas is in the Pensiangan or Sapulut district where
elephants are now quite commonly seen near villages, feeding on fruit trees
and destroying other crops as well.”
When asked about how successful the translocation operation activities had
been, Ambu said it cost up to RM30,000 per elephant.
But sometimes, just a few weeks after the elephant had been translocated,
it ended up going into other human populated areas, causing problems there,
he said.",1

It’s the wont of poachers to hack through trunks of tuskers with chainsaws
to retrieve the tusks
'L'-shaped cut in the trunk of a bull with missing tusks raises poaching
worries

The carcasses of two elephants found on Sunday at Jawalagiri forests under
the Hosur forest division of Tamil Nadu has given the jitters to the city's
wildlife conservation community. The remains of the two male adult
elephants, believed to have died a few days ago, were recovered from the
same forest division where the Anchetty gang operates, leading to doubts
about their involvement. The suspicions were triggered after sleuths found
that tusks were missing from one of the dead bulls.

The Hosur division is adjacent to the Bannerghatta and Kanakapura divisions
of Karnataka Forest Department, and together the three constitute an
elephant corridor.

The forest brass at the Hosur division, though, have denied anything amiss,
and have pointed to lightning as the cause of the death. ""The elephants
were found dead. It seems they were killed about a week ago. The reason was
lightning,"" A K Ulaganathan, DFO, Hosur division, told Bangalore Mirror.

But sources revealed to Bangalore Mirror it was not at all comforting to
learn that the trunk was cut in an 'L' shape from one of the tuskers. Those
in the know say that 'L'-shaped cuts are caused by poachers using chainsaws
to hack their way into the tusks through the trunk.

""The dead elephants are both adults. While the small tusks of one of them
were found intact, they were missing in the second elephant. Moreover, its
trunk was cut in an 'L' shape, which points to the operations of an
organised gang involved in removing the tusks of killed elephants. As the
Hosur division abuts our forests, and with the name of the Anchetty gang
popping up in one or the other case of late, our sleuths are also on the
alert,"" a source told Bangalore Mirror.

Wildlife volunteers are now calling for a joint task force to target the
notorious Anchetty gang, which is said to be active in the border areas of
Karnataka and Tamil Nadu.

In July 2013, six tusks were seized by Bangalore police from poachers,
suspected to belong to the Anchetty gang. The questioning of the seven
arrested had taken the probe trail to the Anchetty forests, where arms and
ammunition were hid in rocks. Also in June 2014, Anekal police had seized
two tusks from two suspected poachers, who too hailed from Anchetty.

Given this context, reports about the deaths of two more elephants have
unsettled many wildlife conservation experts. They are also picking holes
in the lightning theory, finding it an unusual explanation for elephant
deaths.

Sharath R Babu, former honorary wildlife warden, Bangalore Urban, told
Bangalore Mirror, ""It's difficult to believe that lightning caused the
elephant deaths. Only a detailed probe will bring the facts out. But the
removal of tusks gives room for suspicions. The 'L'-shaped cut of the trunk
was a hallmark of forest brigand Veerappan and his gang, and is of late
linked to the Anchetty gang. This calls for the formation of a joint task
force by both the states as the gang is active along the Karnataka-Tamil
Nadu border areas.""",1

An adolescent elephant was killed and stripped of its ivory inside
Mondolkiri province’s Phnom Prich Wildlife Sanctuary, according to
environmental officials, who discovered the endangered animal on Friday.

The male Asian elephant, estimated to be about 10 years old, was discovered
with at least one bullet wound in its head and both of its tusks removed.

Two adult elephants and one infant were found slaughtered by poachers in
the same area in October last year.

Chhit Sophal, director of the provincial environment department, said the
animal was likely killed three or four days earlier, and that a lack of
vigilance by Environment Ministry officials in charge of the supposedly
protected area was     to blame.

“If the director of Phnom Prich works on this case, there will be no
solution, and I will have to go there directly with my own officials to do
an investigation,” Mr. Sophal said, referring to the sanctuary’s director,
Samrang Dyvichet.

Mr. Sophal cited the ongoing poaching of gaur and trade in endangered
pangolin as the other failures of authorities overseeing the sanctuary. He
said that while it was clear that the elephant had died at the hands of a
hunter, he would return to Mondolkiri to conduct an autopsy.

“We will ask the WWF [World Wide Fund for Nature] for permission to bury
the dead elephant,” he added.

Mr. Dyvichet confirmed his subordinates were called to inspect the elephant
corpse by a group of ethnic Bunong collecting vines inside the
225,000-hectare sanctuary.

Mr. Dyvichet also defended the competence of his office, saying that it was
impossible to patrol the entire sanctuary for poachers.

“We can’t even keep an eye on all the animals in our district, even though
our officials patrol often, so how can we patrol the entire forest?” he
said. “We will ask the WWF to put a camera [trap] in that area; then it
will be easy to arrest any hunters,” he said.

Mr. Dyvichet said between 120 and 170 elephants remained in the protected
area.",1

Siliguri, Oct 18 (IANS) Two elephants, including a female, were
electrocuted in West Bengal's Darjeeling district Saturday, an official
said.
The tuskers were found in a paddy field in Rakamjot in Siliguri.
""Medical reports confirm they were electrocuted,"" Kurseong Divisional
Forest Officer Sailesh Anand said.
The deaths come a day after the carcass of a four-year-old rhino with its
horn missing was found in Gorumara National Park in Jalpaiguri district.
Meanwhile, forest and wildlife officials are having a tough time preventing
a herd of about 60 elephants from crossing over to Nepal. The herd is
currently camping in Bamanpokhri range of Kurseong forest division.
""We are trying to prevent the herd from straying into Nepal. There have
been instances earlier when elephants have been shot dead while entering
into Nepal,"" said Anand.
Forest officials, including members of elephant squad, are keeping a round
the clock vigil on the herd and are trying all means to prevent them from
straying into Nepal.

JALPAIGURI: Two more jumbos — a tusker and a pregnant female — were killed
in North Bengal on Tuesday. While the tusker was probably poisoned, the
female, the foresters suspect, was electrocuted.

Only three days back, two pachyderms were electrocuted in the region.

The bodies of the elephants were found in two different forest tracts in
Dooars — at Panjhora near Chapramari Wildlife Sanctuary and at Kolabari
near Moraghat forest in Banerhat. ""The female, whose carcass was found in a
paddy field at Panjhora, was probably electrocuted. Primary investigation
confirmed that it was in advance stage of pregnancy,"" said a forest
official.

The other elephant was a sub-adult tusker. Its body too was found in a
paddy field at Kolabari near Moraghat forest. When the foresters checked on
the body, they found blood stains in its trunk which indicated that the
animal might have been poisoned.

The foresters are not ready to say anything about the cause of the death of
the elephants until the post mortem is done.

""The actual reason of death can only be known after post mortem,"" a senior
forester said.

Three days ago, a tusker and a female were found dead in a paddy field at
Rakamjot Bustee near Kolabari forest at Naxalbari.

Though the forest department had lodged an FIR against two villagers, they
are still absconding.

""While one elephant was electrocuted after its trunk entangled in the
wires, the other one died after its tail mired in the wires. This is very
unfortunate and should not have happened,"" said divisional forest officer
of Kurseong Buddhi Rajshiva.

CHITTOOR: An angry herd of elephants kept on trumpeting and roaring for
hours together scaring away people living in nearby hamlets in the forest
area of Ramakuppam in Chittoor district on Friday after one of its members
died due to electric shock.

The herd consisting of 13 pachyderms was crossing the agricultural fields
at Ramapuram tanda of Nakkalgutta in the forest area of Ramakuppam when an
elephant came in contact with a live electric wire set up by poachers to
trap wild boars and deer.

As the elephant lay dead, the other members in the herd surrounded it and
started trumpeting loudly. The wails echoed in the forests causing panic
among nearby villagers. Some of them ran for safety. A forest officials
team visited the spot and advised people against venturing near the angry
elephants

The trumpeting continued for hours. Even forest officials did not go near
the herd. Later, senior forest officials conducted panchanama and sent the
dead elephant for post mortem. A case has been registered. About 30
elephants have been camping in the forest area in Chittoor district for the
last 25 days. Last week, a herd of elephants disrupted train traffic on the
busy Chennai-Bangalore rail road by squatting on the railway tracks.

Forest officials point out that elephants have started liking juicy
tomatoes that are grown in the border areas of Chittoor district, which
otherwise is not a traditional habitat of the pachyderms.",1

Baripada (Odisha): A day after being rescued from a defunct well by forest
personnel, a tusker died Friday in Mayurbhanj district due to critical
injuries sustained in the fall, despite efforts by experts to save it.

The pachyderm could not be saved despite all efforts by experts, Divisional

Veterinary surgeons and experts from Nandankanan Zoo in Bhubaneswar, Odisha
University of Agriculture and Technology and Similipal Tiger Reserve tried

The pachyderm was tranquilised and pulled out of the 30-feet deep well, in
which it had fallen, with the help of a heavy crane near village Dubuasahi
under Dukuda range of Baripada forest division yesterday, Swain said.

A herd of about 25 elephants from the Similipal sanctuary had apparently
entered the area in search of food. While the tusker fell into the
abandoned well on Tuesday night, other elephants left for the sanctuary,
the DFO said.

A postmortem on the elephant would be conducted tomorrow, he said.",1

DHENKANAL:  The rise in number of elephant deaths under Dhenkanal forest
division has left forest officials worried. Seven elephants have died in
Dhenkanal so far this year.

On November 21, an adult tusker got electrocuted at Alusingh village under
Hindol forest range after getting entangled in live wires. The tusker, aged
about 30, was feeding on the crop in a paddy field when it came in contact
with the live wire, said DFO, Pradipta Kumar Sahu. The live wire was
allegedly drawn by a farmer from a low transmission line in the paddy field
for domestic use.

A day later, an elephant calf was found dead under similar circumstances in
Nuakiari village under Hindol forest range.

Locals, however, said they are forced to lay live wires in their
agricultural fields as elephants from the nearby forest frequently destroy
their crops. Although elephant-proof trenches have been dug up in Baabandha
area of Hindol, these are of little help in preventing the animals from
straying into human habitations.

In fact, in the last three years, four elephants have been electrocuted in
Hindol forest range and one in Sadangi forest range. Environmentalists said
electrocution continues to be a primary cause behind elephant deaths in
Dhenkanal, courtesy lack of coordination between the officials of the
Forest department and the Central Electricity Supply Utility (CESU). On the
other hand, forest authorities blamed CESU officials for neglect resulting
in the death of the elephants. They said although several reminders have
been sent to CESU officials to fix the sagging power lines, there has been
no positive response so far.

Poaching too has become rampant in the last few years. Sources said four
elephants have been killed by poachers in four years in the forests
bordering Dhenkanal-Cuttack and Dhenkanal-Keonjhar regions.

In yet another step to check unnatural deaths of elephants, the Dhenkanal
Forest Division has urged the East Coast Railway (ECoR) to reduce the speed
of trains running on Dhenkanal-Angul route.

The DFO said the ECoR authorities have been requested to reduce speed of
the trains from Sadashivpur station to Hindol Road railway station between
6 pm and 6 am every day as elephants use this route to return to the forest
after feeding on crops in the paddy fields.

‘Illegally drawn power lines for private purposes is causing death of wild

A tusker was found dead reportedly after coming into contact with a live
electricity wire at Guddadabeeranahalli in Tarikere taluk on Sunday.

The elephant, aged about 25, is reported to have come in contact with the
wire as it tried to enter the cotton field of Sridhar.

D. Manjunath, Deputy Conservator of Forests, Bhadravati division, told The
Hindu that the incident occurred at the Lakkavalli range of Bhadravati
division.

“The elephant was found dead close to the Bhadra Tiger Reserve area. We
have booked a case with the police against Sridhar, owner of the land,
besides the Mangalore Electricity Supply Company (MESCOM). Sridhar and his
family members are absconding,” the officer said.

G. Veeresh, a wildlife activist who visited the spot, said that this was
the second such incident in two months. Another elephant had died in
September. “Illegally drawn power lines for private purposes had been
causing death of wild animals. The Forest Department should take stern
action against those responsible for such incidents,” he pointed out.",1

""He had not obtained permission from the concerned officials before putting
up the electric fence. We arrested him for killing the tusker,"" a forest
official said.

""Muniraj confessed to his crime. He was remanded in judicial custody,"" said

Ooty: The electrocution of a wild jumbo in a tribal settlement, right in
the heart of the elephant corridor near Ooty, has shocked foresters and
wildlife activists. The foresters have arrested a tribal in this regard. A
wild jumbo, which was a tusker, was found dead on Sunday morning at the
edge of a farmland at Chokkanalli tribal hamlet near Ooty. The hamlet is
located in the Segur valley elephant corridor.

The foresters who rushed to the spot found metal wires around the body and
burn injuries on a portion of the elephant?s trunk. Mr P. Premkumar,
assistant conservator of forests, Nilgiris north division, said upon
investigation, it was found that Raman (30), an Irula tribesman, had
connected a high-voltage power cable to the metal fencing along his
farmland on Sunday night, to thwart any attempt by wild animals trying to
venture into his compound.

The wild tusker, aged about 23 years, must have come in contact with the
electrified metal fence, the current passing through its body having
instantly killed it. ?We have arrested Raman for this illegal activity
which eventually killed the jumbo. We have warned the tribesmen living in
and around the Chokkanalli hamlet not to take to extreme steps, like
energising the fence with high-voltage power lines. They have also been
told about the Wildlife Conservation Act, binding the area, and the
punishment liable if somebody tried to defy the wildlife law,? he added.

When asked whether the arrested tribesman was in the regular habit of
energising the fencing with high-voltage electricity, Mr Premkumar said he
admitted that he had been doing so. ?The tribesman said he used to guard
the farmland at night after activating the fence and switch off the power
when the animals came near the land. He would try to chase them away by
creating noise, using instruments. On Saturday night, however, he had slept
after connecting the power line, which proved fatal for the wild jumbo,? he
added.

Dr E. Vijayaraghavan, the forest veterinary surgeon, who did the autopsy on
the carcass of the jumbo, said burn injuries were found in the trunk region
and a couple of other places.

They are maligned, hooted, jeered, taunted and shouted at, ‘showered’ with
terrifying fire-crackers and spattered with buckshot leaving festering
wounds which make them suffer in slow agony.

These days, after a series of episodes in the tragic human-elephant
conflict (HEC), these majestic animals are getting deeper and deeper into
the bad books of people.

Emotion aside, there is a need to look at these episodes rationally, and
take a lesson from them so that people unwittingly do not become the
triggers of the HEC, was the view of many environmentalists.

“It is vital for anyone living or working in areas where wild elephants
roam to think about the danger that could be posed by a sudden face-to-face
meeting with them,” stresses the Chairman of the Centre for Conservation
and Research (CCR), Dr. Prithiviraj Fernando, a view echoed by many others.

DWC facing criticism amidst staff shortagesIn defence of the DWC which is
troubled by staff shortages and lack of facilities, amidst which it faces
accusations of inaction, Dr. Prithiviraj Fernando underscores the fact that
the HEC can take place at anytime and anywhere across the country, wherever
there are people and elephants.
“It would be impossible for the DWC to be present in all those places.
There are a few million people living in elephant country and the DWC
cannot be expected to play the role of ‘guardian’ to all of them,” he says,
emphasising that it is important for people to take necessary precautions
to avoid meeting elephants.If accidentally, someone sees an elephant on a
path or even a road, get off the road immediately, as no human is a match
for an elephant, is Dr. Fernando’s advice.

“An elephant weighs a couple of thousand kilos and we puny humans about
50-60 kilos. We simply cannot challenge an elephant physically. So if you
see an elephant ahead of you, don’t try to get closer to have a better look
at it.

Don’t try to stand up and shout to scare away the creature. Just bide your
time until the elephant is well away from the area, even if you have to
cancel whatever you are going for, as your life is worth more than anything
else.”

He certainly knows what he is talking about because as a scientist and
researcher his work revolves closely around elephants across Sri Lanka as
well as other countries which are home to elephants.

Check out the pattern whenever, sadly, a person gets killed in a face-off
with a wild elephant, he urges, explaining that “we need to learn lessons
from these incidents”.

According to Dr. Fernando anyone who is living in areas with elephants,
should try as far as possible to avoid coming into contact with them.

Unless absolutely necessary like in instances of illness or emergencies,
people should not be out of their homes at night on foot when they know
elephants are about. Even in an emergency requiring night travel, being on
foot or on a motorcycle or bicycle should be a “no, no” if possible, with a
better option being a vehicle such as a van.

For all those living in such areas, he suggests that if they are stepping
out of their homes at night, they should first flash a torch around to see
whether there are elephants around, as otherwise their very lives could be
in danger if they suddenly come across these pachyderms.

When asked by the Sunday Times of numerous instances of wild elephants
being accused of attacking homes, Dr. Fernando talks of the sad reality of
farmers storing paddy and other grain in their homes.

“Elephants have a strong sense of smell and know when paddy is stored
within. That’s when they raid not only villages but also homes.This is why
farmers eking out a living through cultivations in areas where there are
elephants need to sell off their harvests from the field, without storing
it in their homes until they can get a better price,” he says, adding that
regrettably, it is a toss-up between keeping the paddy in their homes to
get more money and thus facing the major risks of elephants damaging or
toppling their homes and causing injury or death or selling off the harvest
from the fields themselves. What needs to be asked is whether the risk is
worth to bring the paddy home, which acts as a lure for elephants.

Dr. Fernando gets into the pathetic ‘shoes’ of wild elephants to explain
their unenviable plight. Through unplanned development, people have made
massive inroads and encroached into elephant-land.

Then when wild elephants come into what was once their territory but are
now villages, huge amounts of fire-crackers are sent in volleys to get rid
of them. Gradually the creatures get immune or habituated to fire-crackers
and turn marauders.

“The moment a wild elephant breaks a home or a person gets killed, the
Department of Wildlife Conservation (DWC) is called in. The DWC too is
trapped between the anger and the frustration of the villagers and its duty
to protect wild elephants.

Facing the wrath of the villagers, in a bid to chase away the elephants,
the DWC has no option but to flash torches and use buckshot (shotguns with
SG cartridges) to make the elephants flee,” he says.

Yes, the injured elephants may leave that particular area in the hail of
buckshot but what follows is that the link between humans, buckshot, injury
and pain, get imprinted in their minds, the Sunday Times learns.

“Naturally, these elephants become very aggressive and turn killers and the
next time they meet a humble villager along a lonely path or someone
flashes a torch at them, the elephant’s psyche connects that person with
someone wielding a gun, someone who will hurt them.

That is a natural reaction and as defensive behaviour, such elephants will
invariably attack the person, who becomes an innocent victim, adding to the
statistics of the HEC,” says Dr. Fernando.

This elephant-researcher’s explanation is logical and rational – “Remember
that elephants are wild animals. They can be aggressive and they are
unpredictable. Treat them with respect.”

Incidents at hotspotHere are a few incidents of the Human Elephant Conflict
(HEC) this year in the hotspot of the Galgamuwa area in the Kurunegala
District.
Human tragedies:
• August –
A 64-year-old man is killed by a wild elephant when walking along a jungle
path in the night at Moragaswewa-Konwewa.

For several days he had spread a stock of paddy for drying in the open
verandah of his home and on several nights it had been stolen. That fateful
night, when he heard a noise, assuming that the thieves had returned, armed
with a ketta, he had come from the rear of his home, to be confronted by
two elephants feeding on the paddy.
A 35-year-old man is killed in Meegalewa, when a crowd goes to watch a wild
elephant which has come to the area in the evening.
• Early part of the year –
A 50-year-old man is killed while on his way to a coconut estate at
Kumbukkadawala-Polpithigama.
Wild elephant tragedies:

“Elephants have a strong sense of smell and know when paddy is stored
within. That’s when they raid not only villages but also homes.This is why
farmers eking out a living through cultivations in areas where there are
elephants need to sell off their harvests from the field, without storing
it in their homes until they can get a better price,” he says, adding that
regrettably, it is a toss-up between keeping the paddy in their homes to
get more money and thus facing the major risks of elephants damaging or
toppling their homes and causing injury or death or selling off the harvest
from the fields themselves. What needs to be asked is whether the risk is
worth to bring the paddy home, which acts as a lure for elephants.

Dr. Fernando gets into the pathetic ‘shoes’ of wild elephants to explain
their unenviable plight. Through unplanned development, people have made
massive inroads and encroached into elephant-land.

Then when wild elephants come into what was once their territory but are
now villages, huge amounts of fire-crackers are sent in volleys to get rid
of them. Gradually the creatures get immune or habituated to fire-crackers
and turn marauders.

“The moment a wild elephant breaks a home or a person gets killed, the
Department of Wildlife Conservation (DWC) is called in. The DWC too is
trapped between the anger and the frustration of the villagers and its duty
to protect wild elephants.

Facing the wrath of the villagers, in a bid to chase away the elephants,
the DWC has no option but to flash torches and use buckshot (shotguns with
SG cartridges) to make the elephants flee,” he says.

Yes, the injured elephants may leave that particular area in the hail of
buckshot but what follows is that the link between humans, buckshot, injury
and pain, get imprinted in their minds, the Sunday Times learns.

“Naturally, these elephants become very aggressive and turn killers and the
next time they meet a humble villager along a lonely path or someone
flashes a torch at them, the elephant’s psyche connects that person with
someone wielding a gun, someone who will hurt them.

That is a natural reaction and as defensive behaviour, such elephants will
invariably attack the person, who becomes an innocent victim, adding to the
statistics of the HEC,” says Dr. Fernando.

This elephant-researcher’s explanation is logical and rational – “Remember
that elephants are wild animals. They can be aggressive and they are
unpredictable. Treat them with respect.”

Incidents at hotspotHere are a few incidents of the Human Elephant Conflict
(HEC) this year in the hotspot of the Galgamuwa area in the Kurunegala
District.
Human tragedies:

For several days he had spread a stock of paddy for drying in the open
verandah of his home and on several nights it had been stolen. That fateful
night, when he heard a noise, assuming that the thieves had returned, armed
with a ketta, he had come from the rear of his home, to be confronted by
two elephants feeding on the paddy.
A 35-year-old man is killed in Meegalewa, when a crowd goes to watch a wild
elephant which has come to the area in the evening.

An adult tusker was killed at Dhoddamanehaada near Sholur on Thursday,
after it came into contact with an illegally electrified fence inside a
garlic field.

An autopsy was conducted by Forest Veterinarian N.S. Manoharan in the
presence of members of the Nilgiri Wildlife and Environment Association
(NWEA) and wildlife activists on Friday. The tusker, aged between 25 and 30
years, had died either on Wednesday night or during the wee hours of
Thursday. Forest sources said that efforts had been made to conceal the
evidence and added that appropriate action would be initiated against those
responsible for the death of the elephant.

Meanwhile, conservationists regretted that of late death of wild animals
particularly elephants due to electrocution was on the rise. Speaking to
The Hindu they alleged that it was due to poor surveillance. People
cultivating crops near forests are now emboldened to flout rules and
electrify fences.

Urging the government to come down with a heavy hand on the culprits, NWEA
Executive Committee Member K.Vijay said that the punishment should be made
stringent.",3

The death of two elephants ? engaged in patrolling duties at the tiger
reserves in the state ? in quick succession has set the alarm bells ringing
in the forest department.

While Ira, an eight-year-old elephant, died at the Sanjay tiger reserve in
Sidhi on Friday, another female elephant Sudarshini, aged about 20 years,
died while delivering a premature calf at Bandhavgarh on Thursday.

The deaths have punctured the forest department's claims of following the
protocols in the upkeep of the elephants. The pachyderms are extremely
crucial for patrolling in tiger reserves and regular monitoring of tiger
movements.

There are about 50 elephants that are used by the state forest department
for the purpose. The department is already facing a shortage of elephants
and is trying to source more pachyderms from Karnataka.

Sources told HT that the autopsy report of the elephant Ira mentioned that
septicemia or severe infection in the blood had led to the death. On
Thursday, the female elephant Sudarshini died while giving birth to a
premature calf at the Bandhavgarh tiger reserve.

Sources said in both the cases, veterinarians had no inkling of the
problems faced by the elephants. In Ira's case, the infection - that would
have taken many days to develop before turning lethal - went completely
undetected.

In Sudarshini's case, the veterinarians were not expecting a pregnancy as
the elephant had delivered a calf in 2013. The gestation period of an
elephant is about 22 months and veterinarians did not expect the elephant
to be pregnant so soon after the previous birth.

Standard operating procedures for elephant health include deworming and
carrying out blood tests every three months. ""After the deaths, we
consulted the state veterinary institute to inquire why the disease could
not be detected until it became fatal. We were told that in spite of the
periodic tests, the onset of a disease cannot be detected sometimes,"" said

CHITOOR: In a 'mammoth' display of strength and anger, a herd of elephants
went on the rampage, blocking traffic for hours after one of their members
was killed by an over speeding car on the Krishnagiri-Hosur national
highway late on Tuesday night.

The pachyderms seething with rage attacked the accused car and mangled it
beyond repair. Luckily, the two occupants managed to escape unhurt.

The incident took place in a forest area, 35 km away from Kuppam town of
Chittoor district on the Tamil Nadu-Karnataka border. According to forest
officials, a herd of 10 elephants were crossing over to Andhra Pradesh from
Karnataka via Tamil Nadu when a car moving at a high speed hit a pachyderm,
killing it on the spot. Soon after the accident, the herd started
trumpeting and hitting the vehicle. Traffic on the busy national highway
was disrupted for about four hours as the angry herd did not relent.

Later, a team of forest and police officials rushed to the spot and brought
the situation under control. Dharmapuri district forest officer Rajendran
told TOI that the dead elephant was a two-year-old female calf. ""The car
hit the animal on the side resulting in its death. The air bags in the car
saved the occupants,"" the DFO said.

According to Rajendran, every year about 150 elephants migrate between
Tamil Nadu and Karnataka between November and March. They often stay in
Andhra Pradesh for food and water. They return to Karnataka during April.

Elephants like humans, exhibit anger and become easily agitated when
provoked. They also go out of their way to help members of their own
species and often help other animals in the forests too. Forest officials
point out that the display of solidarity by the elephants to the deceased
member of their herd is a natural reaction.

This is the second incident in the last three months of elephants losing
their temper on the AP-TN border villages. A herd of pachyderms created
panic, roaring and trumpeting for hours together in Chittoor district a
couple of months ago after one of members died due to an electric shock
while crossing agricultural fields. A farmer had erected the electric fence
to ward off wild boars. Elephants had also killed two people including a
forest watcher in the border villages during the current migratory season.",1

Itanagar: The forest department of Pasighat in East Siang district has
caught eight persons in connection with wildlife hunting cases till date
after conducting an inquiry into the crime.

Unabated hunting of wild elephants was reported from the forests in the
Mebo area. Unidentified poachers killed a couple of wild elephants near
Siluk village under Mebo sub-division and captured an elephant calf. They
took it to Dambuk in Lower Dibang Valley, a source said here on Friday.

The forest officials subsequently picked up four persons from Siluk (East
Siang) and Dambuk (Lower Dibang Valley) villages and booked them under
Wildlife Protection (WLP) Acts. Later, they were handed over to police for
further action. The accused, however, managed to get bail.

Later, a joint team of forest department and police nabbed four others,
including two elephant trainers, from Kerem area of Namsai district early
in February. The investigating team also recovered two elephant calves from
their possession.

According to report, the four accused (arrested under WLP Act) have
admitted their offence before the investigating officers.",1

Nayagarh: Deaths of four elephants over last five months have raised doubts
over the safety of pachyderms in the district.

The district has a rich forest cover with many wild animals living inside.
Lack of patrolling by forest officials has only emboldened the latter to
carry out their work with impunity.

Jumbos have become the most vulnerable of wild animals in the forest.
Poachers easily get into jungles and kill elephants. Locals alleged that
involvement of an inter-state racket could not be ruled out as poachers
kill elephants for their tusks and hide.  This has triggered wide-spread
resentment among wildlife enthusiast and elephant lovers.

Deaths of four elephants in five months have highlighted the inefficiency
of forest officials who do not bother to ensure security of wild animals in
the forests.

Two of the jumbo carcasses were recovered from Daspalla forest range while
the third was recovered from Nuagaon forest and the fourth one was
recovered from the reserve forest under Mahanadi wildlife division in the
district.  Forest officials, however, maintained silence on the issue and
have done nothing to arrest the trend.

In the first incident, decomposed carcass of a tusker was noticed from
Birigidi jungle under Daspalla forest range in Nayagarh forest division in
May. Locals had claimed the involvement of poachers in the killing. Even
though forest officials were informed about this they did not so much as
visit the spot. They forgot their role beyond recovering the carcass and
having a post-mortem done. On the contrary, they covered it up saying the
animal died because of sunstroke.

In the second incident, the carcass of a female elephant calf was recovered
and the forest officials claimed it occurred because of a fight between the
herd members. They buried it after a post-mortem.

The third incident was highlighted the most as three forest guards, two
foresters had been suspended and the Daspalla forest ranger was transferred
for trying to cover up an elephant death in Chadheyapalli reserve jungle in
June.  Locals noticed a dead elephant in Chadheyapalii reserve forest and
informed forest officials. The latter did not visit the spot or recover the
carcass. They tried to cover it up.

Actions were taken against them after complaints were filed before the
principal chief conservator of forests.

The fourth incident occurred August 31 when a female elephant was found
lying dead in Kandheinala jungle near Palba village under Nuagaon forest
range.  It was alleged that the elephant was shot dead by locals while it
tried to stray into the paddy field. Forest officials later claimed it died
due to infections.",0

missing, making it evident that it was the work of poachers.

Three suspects were arrested from Uttar Poro Basti later in the evening.
Autopsy revealed that the tusker was shot at, which possibly resulted in
its death. The head was chopped off after that.

said. A tusker had been similarly poached at Sakham on the outskirts of

COIMBATORE:A tusker about 25 years old died due to electrocution at the
Shanmuga coffee estate in Valparai forest range in the Anamalai Tiger
Reserve (ATR) on Saturday.

The animal seems to have accidentally touched an electric wire passing
overhead with its trunk. The tusks were removed and the carcass buried at
the same place, officials said.

The Forest Department received the information about the dead elephant at
around 3.30 pm on Saturday. However only on Sunday morning did a department
team, including Valparai forest ranger Krishnasamy and forest veterinarian
N S Manokaran, visit the spot.

The officials said they were unable go there earlier as it was located in
the interior. Besides, by the time they got there, it would not be possible
to carry out the postmortem.

“The tusker, about 25 years old, died after it touched an electric wire
passing through the estate with its trunk. This obviously happened when it
tried to raise the trunk. The lone passes over a low-lying area,” said
Krishnasamy.
Dr Manokaran performed the postmortem and took samples from the elephant’s
body which were sent for further analysis.

The increase in the number of incidents of wild-elephant deaths in the ATR
is worrying wildlife activists. However, this is the first time in recent
years that a wild elephant is dying due to electrocution in Valparai.

A Sumatran elephant has been found dead in Indonesia's Aceh province with
its tusks cut off, raising suspicion it was killed by poachers.

Genman Sefti Hasibuan, head of the local Conservation and Natural Resources
Agency said the carcass of the estimated 25-year-old male elephant was
discovered Monday inside a palm oil plantation in Karang Hampa village in
West Aceh District.

It was reported to have been rotten and missing its tusks, Hasibuan said
Tuesday. Villagers estimated it died four to five days earlier from gunshot
wounds.

It was the first elephant death in Aceh this year, Hasibuan said, adding
that a team has been sent to the area for investigation.

The International Union for Conservation of Nature listed the animals as
""critically endangered"" after their numbers dropped to between 2,400 and
2,800 from an estimated 5,000 in 1985.

Environmentalists say the elephants could be extinct within three decades
unless they are protected.

Sumatra's elephants sometimes venture into populated areas searching for
food due to destruction of their habitat. Some are shot or poisoned with
cyanide-laced fruit, while others are killed by poachers for their ivory.

In February, police in Riau province arrested eight members of a poaching
syndicate and confiscated tusks worth more than $30,000, following the
arrest of a local tusks buyer. The group admitted to have killed at least
six elephants in Riau and neighboring Jambi provinces.",1

The state forest department is facing criticism after a captured wild
elephant died in Amberi in Mangaon tehesil, Sindhudurg district. The
elephant, captured February 15 in the Naneli forest and named Ganesh, died
on April 10. The same day, a postmortem was conducted and Ganesh was
cremated.

Captured elephants are kept in a top-open wooden enclosure (called kraal).
The intense heat - the temperature in Sindhudurg has reached to 38-39
degrees - is giving the captured elephants health problems. After Ganesh's
death, it has been revealed that the forest officers have never requested
the state or central authorities for elephant-expert veterinary doctors.
""We don't have 24/7 veterinary doctors to look after the captured
elephants,"" Ramesh Kumar, deputy conservator of forests, Kolhapur division
under which Sindhudurg falls, admitted.

""The assistant commissioner of livestock from Kudal does visit these
elephants at Amberi once a week, but it is not sufficient because neither
is he trained in elephant health nor can he pay regular attention to them.
These government veterinary doctors have experience of domestic animals;
relying upon them for elephants' heath is creating a big problem in
captured wild animals' well-being.""

Of the other two captured elephants, Samarth is 30 years old and Bhim is
50. ""Bhim is also unwell and needs immediate proper medical care,"" Kumar
said. He said that he will write to the state authorities demanding an
elephant-expert veterinary doctor.

According to Kumar, Ganesh's post-mortem report shows he died of a
cardiovascular attack. The viscera have been sent to the Maharashtra
government's forensic lab in Pune where all veterinary forensic work is
conducted. The report is awaited.

Vijay Palkar, a local journalist who has been following Sindhudurg's wild
elephant problem since 2002, said: ""If available veterinary doctors have no
expertise in elephant health, how can they conduct a postmortem on them?
Now the dead elephant is cremated so we don't even have enough proof of
injuries he succumbed to.""

Meanwhile, a video showing animal trainers mercilessly beating up captive
wild elephants has been widely circulated in the district. A four-member
team of the Karnataka forest department is in Amberi to train captured
elephants. The wild animals often cross into Maharashtra from Karnataka.

An eyewitness told Mirror: ""When we questioned this brutal kind of
training, we were told that this is the way to train these tuskers, and
that such injuries do not harm the elephants.""

The eyewitness alleged that sticks with knives tied to them were regularly
used to train the elephants.

Kumar denied these allegations: ""These four members were paid 20,000 each
per month by our department. They are trained in such activity, as they
have experience in Karnataka."" Rs 69 lakh was sanctioned in December first
week after special permission was granted by the central environment and
forest ministry to capture these wild elephants, which were causing serious
trouble to the people in Sindhudurg. Four trained elephants from
Karnataka's forest department brought to Sindhudurg to help in the capture
of the three wild tuskers were insured by the Maharashtra forest department
for Rs 5 lakh. The captured animals are not insured.

Since 2004, five wild elephants have died in Sindhudurg out of which three
were female. Two died post-capture and one female died due to a medicine
overdose. But then one cannot be sure of the cause of death. Now, the MNS's
district branch has demanded that the Kudal police investigate Ganesh's
death.",1

An elephant, which seems to be suffering from severe ulcers in and around
its mouth, was seen standing just outside the forest area in Mankarai since
Wednesday morning. Since the forest veterinarian has not been available
throughout the day, none of the forest rangers or public have been able to
approach the animal and help it.

elephant's mouth seems to be injured due to ulcers and it was not being
able to eat anything,"" he said.

Conservationists believe the elephant, to be around 18 to 20 years old,
developed ulcers after consuming crops sprayed with fertilizer. ""The
chemicals must have reacted and caused ulcers,"" said Siva.

Though forest officials were informed and have begun watching the elephant
since morning, nobody has approached it yet. ""Nobody is available to

VIZIANAGARAM:  ‘Operation Gaja’ undertaken by the forest officials to trace
and rescue a missing tusker with the help of two trained elephants in the
forest area at Ravivalasa near Salur agency in Vizianagaram district was a
huge success here Tuesday. The operation was launched to save the jumbo,
who was found missing following its partner’s electrocution last week in
the agency.

‘Operation Gaja’ deployed a large number of forest staff from Srikakulam,
Vizianagaram and Visakhapatnam districts to Janauaryvalasa forest to trap
the tusker. The authorities brought two trained elephants, Jaya and Vijaya,
from Chittoor district and set them in the forest area of Janauaryvalasa
Monday evening. The trained elephants, according to instructions of the
trainer, searched and approached the missing elephant and developed a
friendship with it. Sources said that as instructed by the trainer after
developing friendship, they remarkably brought the tusker to the camp area
Tuesday afternoon, where the authorities trapped it.

Divisional Forest officer, Vizianagaram, IKV Raju said that they have
successfully caught the jumbo with the help of the elephants as well as
their staff. The rescued elephant will be sent to Indira Gandhi Zoological
Park at Visakhapatnam, he informed.

Last week, the rescued elephant along with his partner wreaked havoc in the
agency, where one of it was electrocuted. After the incident, the officials
realised that the second elephant was missing and launched a search
operation. However when the search failed, the authorities quickly brought
in the trained elephants from Chittor.

Sources said that the Vijaya and Jaya are experienced in such operations
and have a successful track record of taming wild elephants.",1

While cross-border infiltration of humans has been a hotly debated issue
between Bangladesh and India and particularly West Bengal, this time the
gruesome killing of an Indian lone tusker that strayed into Rajsahi
district of Bangladesh from Murshidabad district of West Bengal has raised
a storm of protests.
The Bangladesh Border Guards pumped 34 bullets into the tusker and it died
instantly on Monday afternoon.The carcass was buried immediately by the BBG
and later they informed the Indian officials about the killing. It all
happened when a West Bengal wildlife team had reached the border with
tranquilising guns to bring back the elephant into West Bengal. “But
unfortunately we did not get an opportunity,” said member of the team.
The West Bengal Wildlife officials plan to lodge a report to the Project
Elephant drawing its attention to the tragic and brutal killing of the
elephant and to take up the issue with the wildlife wing of both the
countries.
The Indian tusker (Wildlife officials like to describe it as an Asiatic
elephant) from the Dalma range of Jharkhand had strayed and travelled over
500 kilometer through several districts of West Bengal to finally cross
over into Bangladesh having swam across the mighty Padma river at a place
called Nimtita in Murshidabad district of West Bengal yesterday morning.
On the Bangladesh side, the Bangladesh Border Guards (BBG) taken aback by
this unusual intrusion tracked it sometime before pumping 34 bullets into
the pachyderm, killing it on the spot. It had 2-feet long tusks and was
described by West Bengal Wildlife officials as a young lone tusker that
somehow had got detached from its herd.
A top official of the West Bengal Wildlife wing rued that its team was
ready on the border to cross-over and drive back the elephant, but the BBG
allegedly did not give any time and defended their action saying it was
about to enter a village and there was fear of loss of lives. After killing
the elephant, the BBG dug a grave to bury it, too.
The director, Project Elephant, R K Srivastava, when contacted said that he
was yet to receive any report regarding this tragic killing of an elephant.
But should the West Bengal Wildlife wing lodge any complaint with the
Project Elephant, it would definitely initiate actions to take up the
matter with the Bangladesh government at the highest level, said Srivastava.
He, however, pointed out that trans-border measures to deal with such
problem with Bangladesh government are at a very preliminary stage but it
had been initiated. He said “there was little that the West Bengal Wildlife
wing could do against the ‘crime’ committed in Bangladesh by the killing of
the endangered animal. After all, Indian Wildlife Acts are not valid in
Bangladesh,” Srivastava said.
Mr M.K.Nandy a former Principal Chief Conservator of Forests in West Bengal
had been working on finding solution to a similar problem but with greater
a magnitude – that of migration of elephant herds from West Bengal to Nepal
and vice versa. While in Bengal there are strict laws and adherence to
rules for wild life protection, in Nepal the response on several occasions
had been similar to what Bangladesh had done.
The Nepal Army used to fire upon the elephant herds (they used to describe
these as ‘Indian Elephants’) indiscriminately to drive them back into the
North Bengal forests. On several occasions the aftermath had been
disastrous. Injured elephants hit by bullets created havoc in North Bengal,
killing men and women in fits of rage after being injured in such firing
incidents by the Nepal Army, police and forest guards.
Nandy said that the WWF has provided some funds to the West Bengal forests
department to set up wire fencings along Mechi river that divides Nepal and
North Bengal near Siliguri. He further said that a project funded by the US
Fish and Wildlife wing on this atrocity on elephants and ways to stop it is
underway between officials of the two countries and the first phase has
been completed.
The completion of the project should see more restrained and rational
responses to such migration of elephants, he said.  It was known form
elephants experts that there are about 138 interstate elephant migration
routes within Indian while there are",2

Nayagarh: Deaths of four elephants over last five months have raised doubts
over the safety of pachyderms in the district.

The district has a rich forest cover with many wild animals living inside.
Lack of patrolling by forest officials has only emboldened the latter to
carry out their work with impunity.

Jumbos have become the most vulnerable of wild animals in the forest.
Poachers easily get into jungles and kill elephants. Locals alleged that
involvement of an inter-state racket could not be ruled out as poachers
kill elephants for their tusks and hide.  This has triggered wide-spread
resentment among wildlife enthusiast and elephant lovers.

Deaths of four elephants in five months have highlighted the inefficiency
of forest officials who do not bother to ensure security of wild animals in
the forests.

Two of the jumbo carcasses were recovered from Daspalla forest range while
the third was recovered from Nuagaon forest and the fourth one was
recovered from the reserve forest under Mahanadi wildlife division in the
district.  Forest officials, however, maintained silence on the issue and
have done nothing to arrest the trend.

In the first incident, decomposed carcass of a tusker was noticed from
Birigidi jungle under Daspalla forest range in Nayagarh forest division in
May. Locals had claimed the involvement of poachers in the killing. Even
though forest officials were informed about this they did not so much as
visit the spot. They forgot their role beyond recovering the carcass and
having a post-mortem done. On the contrary, they covered it up saying the
animal died because of sunstroke.

In the second incident, the carcass of a female elephant calf was recovered
and the forest officials claimed it occurred because of a fight between the
herd members. They buried it after a post-mortem.

The third incident was highlighted the most as three forest guards, two
foresters had been suspended and the Daspalla forest ranger was transferred
for trying to cover up an elephant death in Chadheyapalli reserve jungle in
June.  Locals noticed a dead elephant in Chadheyapalii reserve forest and
informed forest officials. The latter did not visit the spot or recover the
carcass. They tried to cover it up.

Actions were taken against them after complaints were filed before the
principal chief conservator of forests.

The fourth incident occurred August 31 when a female elephant was found
lying dead in Kandheinala jungle near Palba village under Nuagaon forest
range.  It was alleged that the elephant was shot dead by locals while it
tried to stray into the paddy field. Forest officials later claimed it died
due to infections.",1

the incident took place in the border of a private patta land.

The forest officer said that banana was cultivated in the estate and the
owners had drawn power connection from the electricity wire illegally for
the estate fence to keep away tuskers. It is learnt that the animal died

A tusker died after coming in contact with a live electrical wire at IBC
Company coffee estate at Kadlur Koplu village in Alur taluk on Friday
night. The elephant, aged about 25 years, came in contact with 11-kV
sagging power line in the estate, which came to light on Saturday morning,
when workers reached there.

Ganesh S. Bhat, Deputy Conservator of Forests, told The Hindu on Saturday
that negligence of the electricity supply company was the reason for the
incident. The Forest Department would file a case against the
Chamundeshwari Electricity Supply Corporation for the alleged gross
negligence.

Parts of Alur and Sakaleshpur taluks in Hassan district are known for the
conflict between man and animal. In the last 10 years, more than 50 people
have died in elephant attacks and around 35 elephants have died, many of
them due to electrocution. Following constant demand from the people, the
Forest Department conducted a drive to capture wild elephants in the area
and relocate them elsewhere. In the first phase, the department had the
permission to capture 25 elephants in the operation conducted in November
and December of 2014.",1

PALAKKAD:  A female elephant in an advanced stage of pregnancy fell into an

instantly in Nenmara here on Monday.

Nenmara forest range officer B Renjith said that the post mortem
examination performed by veterinarians Dr Biju and Dr Jayasree  revealed
that there was a fully developed calf inside its stomach.

The she-elephant which was between the age of 15 to 20 years could not see
the well which had no compound wall as it was pitch dark. He said that
there was a street light around 20 metres away but it was not functioning
due to the rains and winds.

The well had a depth of more than 20 metres and it was in a private
compound. The elephant fell with its face down and was suffocated to death
as it could not move.

He said the elephant would have been part of a herd which frequented the
area as the forests were located around 30 metres away.

The forest personnel who reached the spot included Divisional Forest
Officer N Rajesh, foresters, guards and watchers. Initially a slope was
made into the well. It was the watchers who entered the well and tied
the ropes to the legs of the elephant to pull it out using earth movers.

After the post mortem, the carcass of the elephant was buried in the nearby
Nelliampathy forests.",1

The war between humans and elephants rages in southwest China's Yunnan
Province.

This year alone, three people have been killed by wild elephants there, and
three elephants are known to have been killed by either pesticides or
gunshot.

A villager from Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture, a popular tourist
destination where elephants feature prominently on any itinerary, was
detained by police on Sunday for killing a pregnant wild elephant. Named by
police as Wang, the villager opened fire with a homemade gun on a group of
wild elephants that had invaded his land. A female elephant weighing more
than 3 tonnes was later found dead in Wang's fish pond with a bullet in her
head. The cow was carrying a 99-kilogram male calf and was almost ready to
give birth.

On June 26, two immature bull elephants were found dead with blood oozing
from their mouth, trunk and anus. Police found pesticides in the stomaches
of both and have not ruled out the possibility that they were poisoned by
farmers. As many as 16 wild elephants were seen in the area at the end of
November and various incidents have since been reported.

Asian elephants are an endangered species and protected in China. About 250
to 300 roam Xishuangbanna and other parts of south Yunnan. Fragmented
habitat means they often intrude into villages, damage crops and even
attack humans.

FOOTPRINTS IN THE BUTTER

A villager died after being attacked while working in his fields in June.
His wife narrowly escaped death thanks to a shed that collapsed, shielding
her from further attacks. There have been at least three elephant attacks
in the vicinity this year. Two women died from such attacks in the area in
2012 and 2013.

Heavily forested Simao District is an ideal habitat for elephants. About 60
of them are known to roam the district. Six people have died there and nine
have been injured in elephant attacks since 1999. Farmers are afraid to
harvest their crops. Students have nerve-racking trips to school and local
people go less frequently to the market. Some cannot even sleep in their
own houses for fear that hungry pachyderms will break in and raid their
larders.

The number of wild elephants is on the rise, which is certainly a good
thing, but they pillage or trample crops, tear down trees and houses and
are a very real threat to people's lives.

Simao forestry bureau attributed 33 deaths and 165 injuries to wild
animals, mostly elephants, from 1991 to 2010. In the whole province, 1,324
deaths and about 390 million yuan (63.7 million U.S. dollars) of losses
have been blamed on wild animals over the past decade. Such tragedies will
become more frequent if the central government campaign to improve the
environment is successful and elephant numbers increase.

PACHYDERM PICNICS AND PREMIUMS

An adult elephant eats up to 300 kilograms of food each day and drinks a
large amount of water. It walks dozens of kilometers while foraging.

Chen Mingyong, an elephant expert with Yunnan University, believes that
conservation corridors are key to resolving the conflict between man and
beast. Linking the fragmented habitat with protected corridors will reduce
the overlapping space inhabited by both humans and elephants.

Food source bases where bamboo and bananas are grown specifically for the
elephants will also help. Most of the harm done comes from the elephants'
endless search for food.

Simao government spent over 600,000 yuan last year on an ""elephant canteen""
that includes a banana garden, a bamboo forest and a pool. The provincial
government faces mounting compensation bills for damage caused by the
protected animals. The annual cost can run to 10 million yuan.

In 2009, Yunnan contracted China Pacific Insurance Co. to insure crops,
property and lives in some regions. The government pays the premiums and
the insurers investigate and compensate people when animals cause trouble.

Li Laoxiao has tried everything to drive the elephants away from his
plantation, but to very little avail. ""Now I just let them eat. I get 15
yuan for each damaged rubber tree, and 10 yuan for a banana tree.""

The commercial mechanism is clearly more effective. Compensation is higher
and paid more quickly, but rumbling discontent persists. In November, 114
villagers from nine villages in Simao petitioned for better protection and
higher compensation.

Yang Zhengrong of the insurers' Yunnan branch told Xinhua that the company
paid over 81 million yuan in compensation from 2010 to 2013 but received
less than 48 million yuan in premiums.

""The compensation mechanism needs to be improved. It is not sustainable in
the long run,"" Yang said.",1

A 20-year-old elephant in Vietnam’s Yok Don National Park had its right
tusk amputated on Thursday due to an injury caused by unidentified
poachers, the park management said the same day.

The wound on the animal, Thoong Ngan, was caused by poachers who allegedly
used a saw to attempt to cut off the tusk to steal it two days earlier,
said Do Quang Tung, director of the park, located in Buon Don District of
the Central Highlands province of Dak Lak.

The amputation was completed in the afternoon after a group of experts
agreed that the tusk should be removed to save the animal from a possible
dangerous infection, Tung said.

The experts from the park, the Ho Chi Minh City-based Saigon Zoo and
Botanical Garden, the Netherlands’s Rotterdam Zoo, and the Animal Asia
Foundation discussed treatment for the injured elephant.

Veterinary surgeons gave Thoong Ngan, 20 years old, an anesthetic and then
cut off its injured tusk, Tung said.

Thoong Ngan is seen after its right tusk was severed on July 16, 2015.

“At 5:30 pm, the cutting was completed and the elephant recovered after the
anesthetic’s effect wore off,” Tung added.

Before the operation, the park management had conducted ceremonial rituals
according to the customs of the Ede minority people.

Poachers’ attack

Early Tuesday morning, Thoong Ngan, with a chain around its legs, was
released to Yok Don National Park to search for food, Y Vi Xien, a mahout
who directly manages the elephant, said.

At 8:00 am the same day, Xien found the animal stuck between two large
trees by a strange chain, with its right tusk cut at a depth of two-thirds
of its width, probably with a saw, he said.

Vien assumed that the animal had become stuck on the trunk of one of the
trees while it was searching for food, and unidentified poachers managed to
drive the animal into the space between that tree and another, Xien said.

The poachers then used another chain to fix the animal between the trees
and later used a saw to cut its right tusk, the mahout guessed.

It is believed that the poachers later fled from the scene out of fear when
the elephant bellowed in pain, as the saw touched the marrow inside its
tusk, Xien said.

Before suffering the incident, Thoong Ngan was used to carry tourists every
day, he added.

No culprits found

Since 2009, at least six elephants in Dak Lak have been killed for their
tusks and other organs, but authorities have yet to identify any culprits,
Yok Don National Park director Tung said.

The park now has four elephants, of which only Thoong Ngan and another
still have their tusks, which are considered the most beautiful in Vietnam,
he said.

The director added that the purported sawing of the tusk is the first such
incident to have ever happened in the park.

After a gap of over five years, poachers made their presence felt in
Sundergarh district, and this activation has come after a long time. It had
last happened during 2008-09 when the district had witnessed poaching of
elephants. On 2nd July in 2015 poachers shot down a young male tusker
inside the forests near Badkundar village with an arrow.

The forest department had prior information regarding the movement of
poachers in the vicinity. So, three squads were moving in search of them.
The elephant was shot on a hill slope. The impact of the arrow was so
intense that it died immediately and came rolling down. The dead animal
could have gone down further but the stump of a tree stopped it.

DFO Bonai Santosh Kumar Banchur said, “we recovered the body later and we
found it dead. However, the poachers could not cut the two tusks due to the
presence of our team as it takes some time to do that”. The poachers had
tried to cover the body with leaves so that it could not be detected and
later on they could have extracted the tusks.

“We were sure that they were inside the jungle for poaching so the patrol
continued” informed the DFO. The departmental squad found the body late and
sent it for post-mortem. Al arrow struck to the body of the pachyderm near
its heart”, informed Banchur.

The DFO informed that the poachers were in all probability from North
Eastern region of the country.

“According to our information they all looked very fair and not very tall
with oriental facial structures. Besides, such weapons are used in that
part for killing elephants”, he said.

The arrow, which is a 6-7 inches long cylindrical shoot of bamboo, is a
very specially designed one.

The poachers put an extremely sharp iron nail on the top of it and shoot at
the target.

“I am sure they were firing from a gun as such a small arrow cannot be shot
from a bow”, informed Banchur. The sharp iron nail was not found in the
post-mortem. In 2014, such kind of weapon was used at Sambalpur by the
poachers.

They were spotted near Tamra range by locals and we have spread the message
to keep an eye on any movement”, informed the DFO. The two tusks measured
nearly three feet each and weighed 2.1 and 2.3 kg respectively.

It was in 2008-09 that some hunters’ had forayed into the district and had
killed some of the tuskers.

At that time there were locals who were involved with them and a local was
the main kingpin along with those coming from other parts. In 2014 the
police arrested the local kingpin while he was moving inside the jungles of
Gurundia.",1

A villager in southwest China's Yunnan Province was detained for killing a
pregnant wild Asian elephant that intruded into his home, the local
government said Tuesday.
The villager, surnamed Wang, allegedly opened fire on a group of intruding
wild elephants with a homemade gun early on Sunday, the press office of
Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture said in a statement.

One female elephant was later found dead in Wang's fish pond, with a bullet
in its head. It was carrying a male calf and was about to give birth soon,
the document said.

Wang told police he had yelled hoping to scare the elephants away, but of
no avail.

The document did not say what penalties Wang might face.

Wild Asian elephants are an endangered species under protection by the
Chinese government. About 250 to 300 are roaming in Yunnan's Xishuangbanna,
Puer and Lincang.

But wild elephants often intrude villages, damage crops and even attack
humans. This year alone, three people died after being attacked by wild
elephants, and several others were injured, the local forestry department
said.",1

The Forest Department probing the Edamalayar elephant poaching case has
recovered the carcass of three more elephants, allegedly gunned down by the
poaching gang led by Aikkaramuttom Vasu.

With this, the total number of elephants killed by the poachers has reached
nine.

Officials said the carcasses of two elephants were spotted in the
Ekkakauzhy region near the Athirappilly forests while the third one was
found inside the Vazhachal forest division.

The carcasses were found during a search by the department, which took Jijo
and Eldhose, key members of the poaching gang, along with them.

“The focus of the search will now be on the Athirappilly and Vazhachal
regions, where the poachers reportedly hunted more elephants.

However, the huge concentration of wild elephants combined with adverse
weather conditions in the area is preventing us from extensive combing of
the area’’, said a senior forest official with the Malayattur forest
division.

The department has so far arrested 28 persons in connection with the case
and is on the lookout for six more for allegedly helping the poachers to go
into hiding.

Meanwhile, yet another person arrested in connection with the case had been
admitted to the Muvattupuzha general hospital, allegedly following
custodial torture.

The latest to be hospitalised is Aji Bright, 12th accused in the case,
sources said.

While reports suggesting that Aji suffered serious injuries to his spinal
code have come out, the hospital authorities refused to share the details.

“Aji was admitted to hospital two days back and was discharged on Wednesday.

We cannot share any details about his treatment at this point of time’’,
said Dr George, Regional Medical Officer, Muvattupuzha.

Earlier, three others, Prinston Silva, Sukumaran and Manoj, were also
hospitalised allegedly after being injured in custody of the forest
department.

“All the arrested persons have invariably sustained injuries below the
knees’’, pointed out C.P Udayabhanu, counsel for Manoj, owner of the
farmhouse where Vasu was found hanging.

The forest officials, meanwhile, denied the reports and pointed out that
the accused had not raised it in the court.

The carcasses were found during a search by the department, which took Jijo
and Eldhose, key members of the poaching gang, along with them.",1

The Forest Department probing the Edamalayar elephant poaching case has
recovered the carcass of three more elephants, allegedly gunned down by the
poaching gang led by Aikkaramuttom Vasu.

With this, the total number of elephants killed by the poachers has reached
nine.

Officials said the carcasses of two elephants were spotted in the
Ekkakauzhy region near the Athirappilly forests while the third one was
found inside the Vazhachal forest division.

The carcasses were found during a search by the department, which took Jijo
and Eldhose, key members of the poaching gang, along with them.

“The focus of the search will now be on the Athirappilly and Vazhachal
regions, where the poachers reportedly hunted more elephants.

However, the huge concentration of wild elephants combined with adverse
weather conditions in the area is preventing us from extensive combing of
the area’’, said a senior forest official with the Malayattur forest
division.

The department has so far arrested 28 persons in connection with the case
and is on the lookout for six more for allegedly helping the poachers to go
into hiding.

Meanwhile, yet another person arrested in connection with the case had been
admitted to the Muvattupuzha general hospital, allegedly following
custodial torture.

The latest to be hospitalised is Aji Bright, 12th accused in the case,
sources said.

While reports suggesting that Aji suffered serious injuries to his spinal
code have come out, the hospital authorities refused to share the details.

“Aji was admitted to hospital two days back and was discharged on Wednesday.

We cannot share any details about his treatment at this point of time’’,
said Dr George, Regional Medical Officer, Muvattupuzha.

Earlier, three others, Prinston Silva, Sukumaran and Manoj, were also
hospitalised allegedly after being injured in custody of the forest
department.

“All the arrested persons have invariably sustained injuries below the
knees’’, pointed out C.P Udayabhanu, counsel for Manoj, owner of the
farmhouse where Vasu was found hanging.

The forest officials, meanwhile, denied the reports and pointed out that
the accused had not raised it in the court.

The carcasses were found during a search by the department, which took Jijo
and Eldhose, key members of the poaching gang, along with them.",0

They are maligned, hooted, jeered, taunted and shouted at, ‘showered’ with
terrifying fire-crackers and spattered with buckshot leaving festering
wounds which make them suffer in slow agony.

These days, after a series of episodes in the tragic human-elephant
conflict (HEC), these majestic animals are getting deeper and deeper into
the bad books of people.

Emotion aside, there is a need to look at these episodes rationally, and
take a lesson from them so that people unwittingly do not become the
triggers of the HEC, was the view of many environmentalists.

“It is vital for anyone living or working in areas where wild elephants
roam to think about the danger that could be posed by a sudden face-to-face
meeting with them,” stresses the Chairman of the Centre for Conservation
and Research (CCR), Dr. Prithiviraj Fernando, a view echoed by many others.

DWC facing criticism amidst staff shortagesIn defence of the DWC which is
troubled by staff shortages and lack of facilities, amidst which it faces
accusations of inaction, Dr. Prithiviraj Fernando underscores the fact that
the HEC can take place at anytime and anywhere across the country, wherever
there are people and elephants.
“It would be impossible for the DWC to be present in all those places.
There are a few million people living in elephant country and the DWC
cannot be expected to play the role of ‘guardian’ to all of them,” he says,
emphasising that it is important for people to take necessary precautions
to avoid meeting elephants.If accidentally, someone sees an elephant on a
path or even a road, get off the road immediately, as no human is a match
for an elephant, is Dr. Fernando’s advice.

“An elephant weighs a couple of thousand kilos and we puny humans about
50-60 kilos. We simply cannot challenge an elephant physically. So if you
see an elephant ahead of you, don’t try to get closer to have a better look
at it.

Don’t try to stand up and shout to scare away the creature. Just bide your
time until the elephant is well away from the area, even if you have to
cancel whatever you are going for, as your life is worth more than anything
else.”

He certainly knows what he is talking about because as a scientist and
researcher his work revolves closely around elephants across Sri Lanka as
well as other countries which are home to elephants.

Check out the pattern whenever, sadly, a person gets killed in a face-off
with a wild elephant, he urges, explaining that “we need to learn lessons
from these incidents”.

According to Dr. Fernando anyone who is living in areas with elephants,
should try as far as possible to avoid coming into contact with them.

Unless absolutely necessary like in instances of illness or emergencies,
people should not be out of their homes at night on foot when they know
elephants are about. Even in an emergency requiring night travel, being on
foot or on a motorcycle or bicycle should be a “no, no” if possible, with a
better option being a vehicle such as a van.

For all those living in such areas, he suggests that if they are stepping
out of their homes at night, they should first flash a torch around to see
whether there are elephants around, as otherwise their very lives could be
in danger if they suddenly come across these pachyderms.

When asked by the Sunday Times of numerous instances of wild elephants
being accused of attacking homes, Dr. Fernando talks of the sad reality of
farmers storing paddy and other grain in their homes.

“Elephants have a strong sense of smell and know when paddy is stored
within. That’s when they raid not only villages but also homes.This is why
farmers eking out a living through cultivations in areas where there are
elephants need to sell off their harvests from the field, without storing
it in their homes until they can get a better price,” he says, adding that
regrettably, it is a toss-up between keeping the paddy in their homes to
get more money and thus facing the major risks of elephants damaging or
toppling their homes and causing injury or death or selling off the harvest
from the fields themselves. What needs to be asked is whether the risk is
worth to bring the paddy home, which acts as a lure for elephants.

Dr. Fernando gets into the pathetic ‘shoes’ of wild elephants to explain
their unenviable plight. Through unplanned development, people have made
massive inroads and encroached into elephant-land.

Then when wild elephants come into what was once their territory but are
now villages, huge amounts of fire-crackers are sent in volleys to get rid
of them. Gradually the creatures get immune or habituated to fire-crackers
and turn marauders.

“The moment a wild elephant breaks a home or a person gets killed, the
Department of Wildlife Conservation (DWC) is called in. The DWC too is
trapped between the anger and the frustration of the villagers and its duty
to protect wild elephants.

Facing the wrath of the villagers, in a bid to chase away the elephants,
the DWC has no option but to flash torches and use buckshot (shotguns with
SG cartridges) to make the elephants flee,” he says.

Yes, the injured elephants may leave that particular area in the hail of
buckshot but what follows is that the link between humans, buckshot, injury
and pain, get imprinted in their minds, the Sunday Times learns.

“Naturally, these elephants become very aggressive and turn killers and the
next time they meet a humble villager along a lonely path or someone
flashes a torch at them, the elephant’s psyche connects that person with
someone wielding a gun, someone who will hurt them.

That is a natural reaction and as defensive behaviour, such elephants will
invariably attack the person, who becomes an innocent victim, adding to the
statistics of the HEC,” says Dr. Fernando.

This elephant-researcher’s explanation is logical and rational – “Remember
that elephants are wild animals. They can be aggressive and they are
unpredictable. Treat them with respect.”

Incidents at hotspotHere are a few incidents of the Human Elephant Conflict
(HEC) this year in the hotspot of the Galgamuwa area in the Kurunegala
District.

Nayagarh: Deaths of four elephants over last five months have raised doubts
over the safety of pachyderms in the district.

The district has a rich forest cover with many wild animals living inside.
Lack of patrolling by forest officials has only emboldened the latter to
carry out their work with impunity.

Jumbos have become the most vulnerable of wild animals in the forest.
Poachers easily get into jungles and kill elephants. Locals alleged that
involvement of an inter-state racket could not be ruled out as poachers
kill elephants for their tusks and hide.  This has triggered wide-spread
resentment among wildlife enthusiast and elephant lovers.

Deaths of four elephants in five months have highlighted the inefficiency
of forest officials who do not bother to ensure security of wild animals in
the forests.

Two of the jumbo carcasses were recovered from Daspalla forest range while
the third was recovered from Nuagaon forest and the fourth one was
recovered from the reserve forest under Mahanadi wildlife division in the
district.  Forest officials, however, maintained silence on the issue and
have done nothing to arrest the trend.

In the first incident, decomposed carcass of a tusker was noticed from
Birigidi jungle under Daspalla forest range in Nayagarh forest division in
May. Locals had claimed the involvement of poachers in the killing. Even
though forest officials were informed about this they did not so much as
visit the spot. They forgot their role beyond recovering the carcass and
having a post-mortem done. On the contrary, they covered it up saying the
animal died because of sunstroke.

In the second incident, the carcass of a female elephant calf was recovered
and the forest officials claimed it occurred because of a fight between the
herd members. They buried it after a post-mortem.

The third incident was highlighted the most as three forest guards, two
foresters had been suspended and the Daspalla forest ranger was transferred
for trying to cover up an elephant death in Chadheyapalli reserve jungle in
June.  Locals noticed a dead elephant in Chadheyapalii reserve forest and
informed forest officials. The latter did not visit the spot or recover the
carcass. They tried to cover it up.

Actions were taken against them after complaints were filed before the
principal chief conservator of forests.

The fourth incident occurred August 31 when a female elephant was found
lying dead in Kandheinala jungle near Palba village under Nuagaon forest
range.  It was alleged that the elephant was shot dead by locals while it
tried to stray into the paddy field. Forest officials later claimed it died
due to infections.",0

The current wave of floods has also caused death to at least three rhinos,
while some deer to have died of drowning, the Kaziranga Ntional Park
director informed.

An adult elephant that was part of a herd that was moving to a highland in
view of the Brahmaputra flood-waters entering and inundating the Kaziranga
National Park in Assam, was electrocuted when it came into contact with a
live electric transmission line that was passing by low.
“Though one of the elephants died of electrocution, the good news is that a
wildlife protection patrol team arrived there on time and managed to divert
the remaining members of the herd before more could come into contact with
the live wire,” Park director MK Yadava told The Indian Express over the
telephone. The incident occurred late Friday night in the Burapahar range
of the 430-km national park in central Assam.
Yadava also said that though the Brahmaputra floods had inundated over 80
per cent of the national park, the water-level had registered a 5-inch
reduction since Saturday morning, and was expected to decrease further
provided there were no fresh rains in the catchment areas in upper Assam
and Arunachal Pradesh.
“The flood level has started receding since Saturday morning, and we hope
it will reduce further, provided there is no more heavy rain upstream. The
flood level this year is about 30 cm less than the highest level of 2014,”
Yadava said.
The current wave of floods has also caused death to at least three rhinos,
while some deer to have died of drowning, the park director informed. “Our
patrol teams have so far located at least two rhino carcasses, both
believed to be drowning cases because the horns are intact. A third rhino
without its horn was found on Friday, but there was no bullet injury on the
animal,” he added.
Speeding vehicles on National Highway 715 that also constitutes the
southern boundary of Kaziranga National Park have knocked down several
animals that were trying to cross over to highlands across the road in the
past one week. “At least six deer have been killed after being run over or
knocked down by speeding vehicles,” Yadava said.
Meanwhile, even as the overall flood situation in Assam remained grim on
Saturday, with the Brahmaputra continuing to flow above the danger level in
Jorhat, Kaziranga, Tezpur, Guwahati, Goalpara and Dhubri.
The number of people affected has risen to over 16.28 lakh, official
sources said. Morigaon, Darrang, Barpeta, Dhubri, Goalpara, Lakhimpur,
Dhemaji, Dibrugarh, Lakhimpur and Tinsukia remained the worst affected
districts. In Morigaon alone, over 2.26 lakh people have been affected,
followed by Darrang with 2.25 lakh.
The current wave of floods also caused intensive damage to standing crops –
mainly paddy – with the Assam State Disaster Management Authority putting
the crop area damaged at 1.45 lakh hectares. Standing paddy has been worst
hit in Tinsukia, Cachar, Darrang, Goalpara and Golaghat districts.",2

JALPAIGURI: Villagers at Milanpalli on the outskirts of Baikunthapur
forest, some 30km from Jalpapiguri, found a tusker lying dead in a paddy
field. The manner in which the pachyderm died has left foresters baffled.

""We are not sure what exactly led to the tusker's death. It can be a
natural death too. We are not ruling out the possibility of electrocution
or poisoning either. Only after post mortem, the reason can be known,"" said
Sanjay Dutta, ranger of Belakoba forest.

This is the second tusker death in the last 10 days. On September 8, an
adult tusker was electrocuted at the Mendabari beat in Chilapata forest
under the Jaldapara National Park.

Incidentally, Friday was Biswakarma Puja and in Dooars elephant is
worshipped as 'Mahakal' on this day. To protest such deaths, the Samaj O
Nadi Bachao Committee, Jalpaiguri, arranged for a hathi (elephant) puja at
the Thana More in the town. Their intention was to create awareness about
elephants among common people.

""As many as six elephants have died over the past one year in Dooars in
places like Baikunthapur, Moraghat, Mongpong, Sevoke and Buxa. We want to
create and awareness and would like to ask the forest department to teach
the vehicle drivers the rules while driving on roads through the forests so
that wild animals can live safely in their habitat,"" said Sanjib
Chatterjee, convener of the committee.

In the pilkhanas (the place where kunki elephants stay) of Gorumara and
Jaldapara national parks elephants were also offered pujas on Friday.",1

Poachers have shot dead two elephants in the Male Mahadeshwara Wildlife
Sanctuary near here for their tusks.

The incident came to light on Monday when shepherds found two carcasses
within a distance of about two km near the Mullupanjara forest area. The
elephants, both male and 15-25 years old, are suspected to have been shot
dead four days ago.

B P Ravi, Chief Conservator of Forests, Chamarajanagar, Javed Mumtaz, the
Kollegal Deputy Conservator of Forests, and other officials visited the
spot.

Staff shortage
The Palar wildlife division is attached to the Sathyamangalam Wildlife
Sanctuary in Tamil Nadu. With the Forest Department being short of staff,
it has become easy for poachers to enter the forest from Tamil Nadu,
sources claimed. As a result, poaching of elephants, deer and other wild
animals is going unchecked in the region, the soures added.",2

A wild bull elephant is believed to have sustained minor injuries after
being hit by a pickup truck and attacking the four people in it in
Kanchanaburi’s Muang district, a senior forestry official said on Sunday.
The elephant ran back into the forest.

The Sidor bull elephant, known for its short tusks, was crossing Highway
No.323 between kilometre markers 32 and 33 at Tha Manao village in tambon
Wang Dong when it was hit by the pickup truck on Saturday night.

A team of forestry officials this morning searched for the elephant in
areas near the crash scene and found no traces of blood.

Wisanti Jaenkarnkhai, 34, the driver of another pickup truck who witnessed
the attack, said he was travelling along the road when the jumbo suddenly
crossed the area. He immediately swerved to avoid hitting the animal.

He then saw a pickup truck coming from the opposite direction. He flashed
his lights to warn the pickup truck about the elephant, but failed. The
pickup truck then hit the jumbo, said Mr Wisanti.

Paithoon Inthabut, chief of Salak Phra wildlife sanctuary, said the
elephant might have been frightened after being hit on one of its rear
legs. This would have caused it to turn back and attack the vehicle. The
elephant used its front feet to stomp on the hood, causing severe damage to
the pickup truck. Four people on board were injured and sent to hospital.

Forestry officials rushed to the scene after learning about the incident
and found the elephant had walked into a nearby sugarcane plantation. They
did not get close to the jumbo as they feared it might be stressed after
the crash, said Mr Paithoon.

The search continued Sunday morning and they found only traces of the
elephant’s footsteps and excrement left along the route to the forest. An
electric fence near the route had been damaged.

The search team found no traces of bloodstains along the route, suggesting
the elephant might have been only slightly hurt by the crash, the Salak
Phra wildlife sanctuary chief said.

The wildlife sanctuary covers 530,000 rai of land and is home to about 270
wild elephants.

He said electric fences and barriers have been set up near a community zone
to prevent elephants from roaming residents’ crop plantations. Night patrol
teams, comprising eight members each, take turns to prevent elephants from
leaving the forest areas.

He urged motorists using Lad Ya-Srisawat road to drive with care,
particularly at night to prevent a recurrence of Saturday’s crash.",1

They are maligned, hooted, jeered, taunted and shouted at, ‘showered’ with
terrifying fire-crackers and spattered with buckshot leaving festering
wounds which make them suffer in slow agony.

These days, after a series of episodes in the tragic human-elephant
conflict (HEC), these majestic animals are getting deeper and deeper into
the bad books of people.

Emotion aside, there is a need to look at these episodes rationally, and
take a lesson from them so that people unwittingly do not become the
triggers of the HEC, was the view of many environmentalists.

“It is vital for anyone living or working in areas where wild elephants
roam to think about the danger that could be posed by a sudden face-to-face
meeting with them,” stresses the Chairman of the Centre for Conservation
and Research (CCR), Dr. Prithiviraj Fernando, a view echoed by many others.

DWC facing criticism amidst staff shortagesIn defence of the DWC which is
troubled by staff shortages and lack of facilities, amidst which it faces
accusations of inaction, Dr. Prithiviraj Fernando underscores the fact that
the HEC can take place at anytime and anywhere across the country, wherever
there are people and elephants.
“It would be impossible for the DWC to be present in all those places.
There are a few million people living in elephant country and the DWC
cannot be expected to play the role of ‘guardian’ to all of them,” he says,
emphasising that it is important for people to take necessary precautions
to avoid meeting elephants.If accidentally, someone sees an elephant on a
path or even a road, get off the road immediately, as no human is a match
for an elephant, is Dr. Fernando’s advice.

“An elephant weighs a couple of thousand kilos and we puny humans about
50-60 kilos. We simply cannot challenge an elephant physically. So if you
see an elephant ahead of you, don’t try to get closer to have a better look
at it.

Don’t try to stand up and shout to scare away the creature. Just bide your
time until the elephant is well away from the area, even if you have to
cancel whatever you are going for, as your life is worth more than anything
else.”

He certainly knows what he is talking about because as a scientist and
researcher his work revolves closely around elephants across Sri Lanka as
well as other countries which are home to elephants.

Check out the pattern whenever, sadly, a person gets killed in a face-off
with a wild elephant, he urges, explaining that “we need to learn lessons
from these incidents”.

According to Dr. Fernando anyone who is living in areas with elephants,
should try as far as possible to avoid coming into contact with them.

Unless absolutely necessary like in instances of illness or emergencies,
people should not be out of their homes at night on foot when they know
elephants are about. Even in an emergency requiring night travel, being on
foot or on a motorcycle or bicycle should be a “no, no” if possible, with a
better option being a vehicle such as a van.

For all those living in such areas, he suggests that if they are stepping
out of their homes at night, they should first flash a torch around to see
whether there are elephants around, as otherwise their very lives could be
in danger if they suddenly come across these pachyderms.

When asked by the Sunday Times of numerous instances of wild elephants
being accused of attacking homes, Dr. Fernando talks of the sad reality of
farmers storing paddy and other grain in their homes.

“Elephants have a strong sense of smell and know when paddy is stored
within. That’s when they raid not only villages but also homes.This is why
farmers eking out a living through cultivations in areas where there are
elephants need to sell off their harvests from the field, without storing
it in their homes until they can get a better price,” he says, adding that
regrettably, it is a toss-up between keeping the paddy in their homes to
get more money and thus facing the major risks of elephants damaging or
toppling their homes and causing injury or death or selling off the harvest
from the fields themselves. What needs to be asked is whether the risk is
worth to bring the paddy home, which acts as a lure for elephants.

Dr. Fernando gets into the pathetic ‘shoes’ of wild elephants to explain
their unenviable plight. Through unplanned development, people have made
massive inroads and encroached into elephant-land.

Then when wild elephants come into what was once their territory but are
now villages, huge amounts of fire-crackers are sent in volleys to get rid
of them. Gradually the creatures get immune or habituated to fire-crackers
and turn marauders.

“The moment a wild elephant breaks a home or a person gets killed, the
Department of Wildlife Conservation (DWC) is called in. The DWC too is
trapped between the anger and the frustration of the villagers and its duty
to protect wild elephants.

Facing the wrath of the villagers, in a bid to chase away the elephants,
the DWC has no option but to flash torches and use buckshot (shotguns with
SG cartridges) to make the elephants flee,” he says.

Yes, the injured elephants may leave that particular area in the hail of
buckshot but what follows is that the link between humans, buckshot, injury
and pain, get imprinted in their minds, the Sunday Times learns.

“Naturally, these elephants become very aggressive and turn killers and the
next time they meet a humble villager along a lonely path or someone
flashes a torch at them, the elephant’s psyche connects that person with
someone wielding a gun, someone who will hurt them.

That is a natural reaction and as defensive behaviour, such elephants will
invariably attack the person, who becomes an innocent victim, adding to the
statistics of the HEC,” says Dr. Fernando.

This elephant-researcher’s explanation is logical and rational – “Remember
that elephants are wild animals. They can be aggressive and they are
unpredictable. Treat them with respect.”

Incidents at hotspotHere are a few incidents of the Human Elephant Conflict
(HEC) this year in the hotspot of the Galgamuwa area in the Kurunegala
District.

For several days he had spread a stock of paddy for drying in the open
verandah of his home and on several nights it had been stolen. That fateful
night, when he heard a noise, assuming that the thieves had returned, armed
with a ketta, he had come from the rear of his home, to be confronted by
two elephants feeding on the paddy.

SEPTEMBER 22, 2015

A CRITICALLY endangered Sumatran elephant who had patrolled Indonesia’s
jungles to help protect threatened habitats has been killed for his tusks,
an official said on Monday, sparking a surge of anger online.

Yongki, a tame creature who worked with teams of elephant keepers, was
found dead close to the camp where he lived in a national park on the
western island of Sumatra, said park official Timbul Batubara.

His one-metre tusks had been hacked off, leaving just bloody stumps, and
his legs still bore the chains put on him by his keepers to ensure he
stayed in the camp.

There are estimated to be less than 3,000 Sumatran elephants remaining in
the wild. They are frequently targeted by poachers for their tusks, which
fetch a high price for use in Chinese traditional medicine.

Batubara, from the Bukit Barisan Selatan national park, said it was not yet
known how Yongki was killed.

His body, which was found Friday, bore no bullet wounds but he had a blue
tongue. Elephants have in the past been poisoned.

Yongki, aged about 35, was well-known among the local “mahouts” or elephant
keepers. Nazaruddin, the head of the Indonesian Mahout Forum, said keepers
in the area were “very shaken”.

“We are mourning the lost of an elephant who has been helping us in
handling conflicts and helping forest rangers patrol the forest, and he was
a good elephant,” Nazaruddin, who goes by one name, told AFP.

The elephant was involved in patrols aimed at reducing tensions, with the
tame elephants stopping wild elephants from rampaging through villages. The
patrols also help rangers keep a lookout for illegal logging and poaching
that threaten Indonesia’s vast rainforests.

There was anger on social media after pictures of the elephant’s body
circulated, with users posting comments on Twitter next to the hashtag
#RIPYongki.

The backlash mirrored the anger that greeted the killing of a protected
lion in Zimbabwe by an American dentist. In July, Walter Palmer provoked
outrage after shooting and beheading Cecil the Lion after luring him
outside of his boundaries.

“It is time we enforce life sentences for hunters of legally protected
animals,” said Facebook user Aprilia Putri.

Protection group the International Union for Conservation of Nature

NEW DELHI (AP) — As their forest habitats shrink and villages edge closer,
it's not uncommon for wild elephants in India to destroy crops and homes
and sometimes even kill people.

Sometimes, coming too close to civilization leads to tragic consequences
for the pachyderms.

In remote parts of the northeastern state of Assam elephants are sometimes
run over by speeding trains.

An elephant was killed early Wednesday when a tree he had uprooted to eat
fell on an electric tower in the Goalpara region of Assam. Villagers said
the rest of the herd of 20-25 elephants tried to help but were scared by
the jolts of power and finally had to abandon the animal.

Devout Hindus also worship elephants as an incarnation of the
elephant-headed God Ganesha. As news of the elephant's death spread, dozens
of villagers poured out to pay their respects to the animal.",1

Local villagers today spotted bodies of two elephants, including a calf,
lying a few meters away from Gunadei canal road near Sadar range along the
National Highway in the district.

The elephant, aged around 15 years, and its calf, around six-month-old, are
suspected to have died after coming in contact with a 33-KV high-tension
electric wire.

The bodies were found lying near the canal, around 100 metre away from
NH-55, this morning.

The pachyderms would have died sometime during last night after coming in
contact with the live wires while crossing the canal, the DFO said. The
carcasses have been seized, he added.

As per reports, the jumbos have changed their path following the ongoing
construction work of Rengali canal. There are low-lying electric wires at
various places through which pachyderms are passing through.

Though the Forest officials have brought this to the notice of the
Electricity department, the latter is yet to initiate steps to avoid
accidents, sources said.

Amid much hue and cry over the twin jumbo deaths, the state government
today filed an FIR against three officials of the local electricity
department and placed two forest officials under suspension.

“FIR has been filed against three staff of electricity department. Case has
been registered against the executive engineer, assistant engineer and a
linesman of the department. Besides, two forest officials—a forester and a
forest guard– were also suspended for dereliction of their duty,” Dhenkanal
DFO informed.",2

found in a jungle in Athagarh five days after its death, another elephant
was found marooned near a water body in Debhuin jungle under Narsinghpur
(east) range.

The tusker has been reportedly moving near the water body for the last
three days, but no efforts were allegedly made by the ranger to move it to
safety.

During his visit to the jungle on Sunday, Principal Chief Conservator of
Forests (wildlife) SS Srivastav directed a veterinary team to attend to the
ailing tusker and has warned the field staff of action if they fail to
protect it from poachers.

 He also assessed the circumstances under which a five-year-old elephant
had died. The carcass was found on Friday, five days after its death.
Elephant watchers said though they had intimated the ranger about the
ailing condition of the elephant at least a fortnight back, no action was
allegedly taken leading to its death.",1

Two endangered Sumatran elephants have been found dead in Aceh province and
are believed to have been poisoned.

The head of the local Conservation and Natural Resources Agency, Genman
Suhefti Hasibuan, says Thursday the carcasses were discovered by locals in

BHUBANESWAR: For all its rhetoric on wildlife conservation, the State
Government has not been able to contain electrocution deaths of the jumbos.

Two female elephants were killed in Bargarh Forest Division on Friday
morning after they came in contact with a live wire in Junani village under
Ambabhana block. Locals had laid traps using electricity supply lines for
wild boars but the pachyderms walked into the farm field and paid with
their lives.

In the last two months, six elephants have died of electrocution in the
State. On October 12, a female elephant and her calf were killed by the
electricity supply lines in Gundlei, about 35 kms from Dhenkanal town.

In the last seven years, at least 69 elephants have  died by way of
electrocution - deliberate as well as accidental. During the period, about
40 elephants were poached while poisoning, another way of killing the
jumbos, claimed 15 lives. As many as 14 elephants died by train hits while
34 died in different accidents.

The fact remains that poaching does not kill more elephants in Odisha,
electrocution does. In absence of monitoring from the Energy Department
which is sitting pretty leaving the matters to distribution companies
(discoms), the vulnerability of the jumbos has grown.

Peeved with a sudden spurt in elephant electrocution deaths in the last two
months, the Wildlife Wing has decided to take up the matter with Principal
Chief Electrical Inspector who is mandated with overseeing maintenance of
the electricity infrastructure in the State.

“The Wildlife Wing has been holding monthly coordination meetings with the
discoms to apprise them of the problem areas which need attention but
infrastructure need to improve along with vigilance which needs more
responsiveness from the Department,” said a senior officer.

Two years back, the State Government had allocated Rs 21 crore for
improvement of electricity infrastructure in elephant corridors to heighten
safety but it has not worked much. Sources in the Wildlife Wing said CESU
jurisdiction remains a matter of concern.

Investigation into the Dhenkanal electrocution deaths revealed that the
local forest staff had spotted the sagging 11 kv line and informed the
Junior Engineer concerned but the latter took plea of a public holiday and
decided to correct the problem later. The outcome was tragic. In last seven
years, at least 438 elephants have died in Odisha.",1

Sonepur: Two female elephants died at the Tithipali Reserve Forest in
Subarnapur district on Sunday morning. Though the exact reason behind the
deaths was yet to be ascertained, Sonepur DFO said the pachyderms might
have died after coming in contact with solar fencing wire.

The solar fencing wire was found connected to a live extra-high tension
wire, resulting in the instant death of the jumbos.

It may be noted that three elephants had been electrocuted in the State
last month. While one pachyderm aged between six to seven years died at
Seramunda in the Nuagada Reserve Forest on October 30, two female elephants
were electrocuted at Unani village under Ambabhana block in Bargarh

BARIPADA:Carcass of a female elephant was found in Subarnamanjari under
Dukura range inside Similipal Biosphere Reserve in Mayurbhanj district on
Tuesday.

The elephant was part of a herd of 16 elephants and had fallen into a gorge
on Monday. The herd, including tuskers, was spotted moving in and around
Subarnamanjari for more than a week.

Forest officials, led by Assistant Conservator of Forest (ACF) Arun Kumar

veterinary surgeons after the herd had moved from the spot following the
elephant’s death.

 DFO Sanjay Kumar Swain said the elephant was about seven years old and
died after falling into a gorge.

The jumbo suffered severe head injuries leading to its death.  Two small
‘tushs’ were found intact and were recovered during postmortem, he said.

 Deputy Director of Similipal Biosphere Reserve Ajit Kumar Satpathy denied
the allegation of poaching because it was a female jumbo. “The cause of its
death can be ascertained once we get the autopsy report,” he said and urged

cable with burn trace on its trunk.

Several broken bamboo wood with burn traces were found near the body.

The elephant was believed to have died a few days earlier.

Electrocution was believed to be the cause but veterinarians needed to
conduct autopsy before making conclusion then exact cause of death.

The death is the second of a wild elephant in the park in three days.

A female jumbo collapsed in Saiyok district of Kanchanaburi on Saturday and
died a day later. The elephant was ageing and died of deteriorating health,
park officials said.

Four forest officials including a forester sustained critical injuries
after they were attacked by elephants while they were trying to recover the
carcass of a dead elephant calf lying near a tank in between Ashwakhola and
Ganeshkhola jungles under Sarangi forest range in Dhenkanal district Monday.

Locals suspected the two-month-old calf might have been shot dead by
poachers as there was a deep injury mark on its head while forest officials
claimed the animal died of a disease.

The dead calf’s mother and a tusker, which were guarding the carcass,
attacked the forest officials when the latter were about to recover the
carcass.

Unnerved by the attack, Joranda section forester tried to run away from the
site but fell down. He sustained injuries on his limbs and chest and was
admitted to a hospital. A member of the elephant squad while trying to
capture the incident in his camera fell into the tank and sustained
injuries. He was rescued by villagers.

In the afternoon, the forest officials made a fresh bid to drive away the
mother elephant and the tusker but were again attacked by the animals. Two
officials sustained critical injuries in the attack.

The pachyderms ran away into the forest after the officials burst
firecrackers and blew sirens. Following this, the forest officials
retrieved the carcass and buried it after post-mortem.

Sources said two herds comprising over 70 elephants staying put in both
sides of Ashwakhola and Ganeshkhola forests have unleashed a reign of
terror in the area, destroying crops and properties, Rajendra Panigrahi and
Soumyajeet Rath, volunteers working with wildlife officials, said.

Divisional forest officer Pradipta Kumar Sahu said parts of the carcass
have been sent for examination to Orissa University of Agriculture and
Technology (OUAT) in Bhubaneswar and the actual reason behind the calf’s
death can be ascertained only after the report is available.

Four elephants have died in this district over the last one month while a
five-month-old calf with severe injuries on its legs was noticed moving
around in Ashwakhola forest. Forest officials are yet to reach to the calf
and start its treatment.",1

A rare Sumatran elephant has been found dead in Indonesia's Aceh province
after apparently eating fertiliser.

The body of the six-year-old male was found in a coffee plantation in Pidie
district on Tuesday, said Genman Hasibuan, the head of the provincial
Nature Conservancy Agency.

""We suspect he died of accidental poisoning because we found splattered

The body had no sign of physical injury and still had his tusks, he said.

Hasibuan said eight Sumatran elephants had been found dead in Aceh this
year, mostly by poisoning by poachers, who removed their tusks.

No one has been arrested, he said.

There are about only 2400-2800 Sumatran elephants in the wild, including
500 in Aceh, according to the WWF conservation group.

The population has dropped an estimated 80 per cent in the last three
generations, or 75 years, according to conservation group IUCN.

have been blamed for the dwindling population.",1

Carcass of a tusker was found by forest officials inside the Similipal
Tiger Reserve (STR) on Saturday. The carcass, with the tusks removed, was
spotted inside Teltangia forest under Baijatala range, 23 km away from
Rairangpur forest division.

The forest officials suspect the animal could have been poisoned and it
could be the handiwork of a well-organised poaching racket.

A herd of 10 elephants has been seen moving around the forest for over a
month now and it had strayed into human habitations nearby and damaged
crops and houses. Locals said the elephant could have been a part of the
herd. Rairangpur DFO AK Swain, forest staff and a veterinary team rushed to
the spot. They buried the carcass after autopsy.

Wildlife activist Akshay Biswal said some unknown persons were seen moving
in the area after the elephant herd strayed into villages.

Sonepur: Two female elephants died at the Tithipali Reserve Forest in
Subarnapur district on Sunday morning. Though the exact reason behind the
deaths was yet to be ascertained, Sonepur DFO said the pachyderms might
have died after coming in contact with solar fencing wire.

The solar fencing wire was found connected to a live extra-high tension
wire, resulting in the instant death of the jumbos.

It may be noted that three elephants had been electrocuted in the State
last month. While one pachyderm aged between six to seven years died at
Seramunda in the Nuagada Reserve Forest on October 30, two female elephants
were electrocuted at Unani village under Ambabhana block in Bargarh

biosphere in Mayurbhanj district on Friday. Sources said the carcass was
found by patrolling staff at Haridachua inside Notto reserve forest, about
30 km from Kaptipada range office under Baripada forest division. The
elephant is suspected to have died three days ago.

Assistant Conservator of Forests (ACF) Arun Kumar Patra, accompanied by a
veterinary team from Sarat region, rushed to the spot. The carcass was
buried after an autopsy.

Baripada DFO Sanjay Kumar Swain said, “Its age would be around 50 years.
The elephant might have died due to old age but post-mortem report is
awaited to ascertain the exact cause of death.” While locals claimed that
the elephant was poisoned to death, forest officials denied the allegation.

Deputy Director of Similipal Tiger Reserve (STR) Ajit Kumar Satpathy said,
“It was difficult for the elephant to move around and collect fodder. It
died due to old age and poisoning was not the reason.”

BARIPADA: The carcass of yet another tusker was recovered in Mayurbhanj
district on Wednesday. This is the seventh elephant death in the district
in the last one month. The series of jumbo deaths has left the forest
officials and wildlife activists worried.

Receiving information, the forest personnel recovered the carcass of the
male elephant from a paddy field near Na’ana village under Gudgudia range
of Karanjia division. The spot is nearly 50 km from Karanjia divisional
office and 4 km from Odisha-Jharkhand border. Its tusks were, however,
intact.

Karanjia DFO Prasanna Kumar Behera said that the 25-year-old tusker’s body
was spotted on Tuesday evening. “It could not be recovered as a herd of
elephants stood guard by surrounding the carcass. Staff kept a watch on the
body in the night and recovered it after the herd left it in the morning,”
he said.

Meanwhile, a scientific team, veterinary surgeons and dog squad along with
senior forest officials visited the spot and collected samples for tests.
Post-mortem of the body would be conducted on Thursday.

Locals alleged that the wild tusker was poisoned to death and it is
suspected to be the handiwork of a well-organised gang of poachers from the
neighbouring State. “As the spot is close to Jharkhand border, the hands of
the poachers from the neighbouring State cannot be ruled out. The poachers
kill elephants by poisoning them through salt,” said wildlife activist
Vanoo Mitra Acharya.

The DFO, however, said that two packets of pesticides were traced by the
dog squad in close ranges of the spot. “We have sent the blood samples to
Bhubaneswar for tests. The report is awaited. We can come to the conclusion
once we get the report and autopsy is conducted,” he added.

Sources said this tusker was a part of the 35-member elephant herd from
Dalma wildlife sanctuary of Jharkhand which had strayed into Mayurbhanj 20
days back. On November 21, another tusker from the same herd was found dead
in Bijatala area under Rairangpur division and its tusks were removed.

Earlier, five elephants had been found dead in Mayurbhanj forests.

While a female elephant died after delivering a stillborn calf at Alakudar
under Kaliani beat in Gudgudia range of Karanjia division on November 23,
another female was found dead in Kaptipada area on November 25.",2

current year

Yet another elephant was electrocuted on the outskirts of Bandipur National
Park, underlining the growing intensity of human-animal conflict on the
forest periphery in the current season.

The elephant came in contact with an electric fence, illegally drawn from
live wires, resulting in instant death on the farm of Bhogaiah at Haadnuru
village in the Hediyala range on Sunday.

The incident took place about half a km from the same spot where another
elephant was electrocuted recently at Haadnuru. A farmer Shivanna was
mauled to death by a tiger in the same village. The tiger was subsequently
shot dead. This is the sixth elephant to be electrocuted around Bandipur
during the current year, while as many as 15 elephants had died under
similar circumstances during 2014-15.

Honorary Wildlife Warden Naveen Kumar, who visited the spot, told The Hindu
that such conflicts were bound to escalate as crops on farms around forest
periphery were ready for harvest. The need of the hour was to take up
maintenance and repairs of the three-metre-deep Elephant Proof Trenches
along areas of high conflicts, especially around Hediyala, Nugu, Moleyuru
and Omkara ranges. “Apart from the trenches, the solar-powered fences
should also be repaired. An amount of Rs. 10 crore is required for the
repair, as the trenches around Bandipur are in bad shape due to inadequate
maintenance,” he added.

Besides, the two-metre-deep trenches cut around the forests earlier were
not insurmountable for the elephants. But wherever the depth of the
trenches was increased to three metres, it was found to be successful in
preventing the elephants from crossing over. The long-term solution was to
finish the first phase of the rail track fences, estimated to cost Rs. 40
crore for execution, which was held up for lack of funds. “Though the State
government has earmarked funds for rail track fencing as a permanent
solution and earmarked Rs. 230 crore towards it, the project is yet to get
started,” said Mr. Kumar.

An emergency meeting of senior Forest Department officials has been sought
on Monday to discuss the issue as it is feared that conflicts were bound to
escalate, Mr. Kumar added.",1

BARIPADA: The forest officials of Mayurbhanj district on Sunday spotted the
carcass of a nine-year-old tusker near Ambapani canal under Sapanchua beat
in Dukura range of Subarnamanjari forest. The carcass is suspected to be
two to three days old, said forest officials.

It is suspected that the sub adult elephant might have been part of
16-member herd which was roaming in Subarnamanjari forest for more than a
month.

The forest officials, led by Assistant Conservator of Forest (ACF) Arun
Kumar Patra and Dukura ranger Batakrushna Padhee, reached the spot with a
team of veterinary surgeons. Padhee said the tusks of the elephant were
intact and no external injury was noticed.

Baripada DFO Sanjay Kumar Swain said its blood samples have been sent for
tests. “As blood was oozing from mouth and nose and the face had started
decomposing, we suspect it is a case of deadly anthrax,” he said.

This was eighth elephant death in the district in a month and second in the
forest.  On November 3, the carcass of a female jumbo was found in a gorge
in the same forest. In last December, an elephant had died of anthrax in
Subarnamanjari forest. The viscera test conducted by Animal Diseases

been removed by the poachers on Tuesday. Those arrested have been
identified as Murali Mahalick, Babuli Mahalick of Durgaprasad village,
Dharmaraj Nayak of Jemadeipur, Gopal Nayak and Prakash Behera of
Chakragarh, all in Cuttack district; Panchanan Kanhar of Badakhajuri
village, Manoranjan Pradhan and Subhaya Pradhan of Surutaganda village
besides, Manmath Kanhar, all in Boudh district.

Informing this to mediapersons, Boudh SP B Gangadhar said Panchanan came to
know that a tusker was limping in Kanya hill, about 6 km from Badakhajuri
under Talgaon gram panchayat. He intimated Manoranjan, who in turn informed
the others. The gang assembled and planned to kill the tusker and do away
with the tusks. They killed the animal on Tuesday afternoon.

However, they ran out of luck when they were returning with the tusks as
SOG jawans intercepted them on the suspicion of being Maoists. On search,
they recovered eight pieces of the tusks, three country-made rifles,
ammunition, an axe and some chemicals from them.  Police suspect that the
nine poachers could be part of a bigger gang and the recovery of tusks has
brought the Forest department under scanner. The tusker was aged about 40
years and the tusks would have fetched 25,000 per kg in black market.

A male elephant was killed and a man badly hurt when an interprovincial bus
rammed into it in Hang Chat district late Friday night. All passengers on
board the bus were unhurt.

The Bangkok-Chiang Mai air-conditioned bus, carrying 25 passengers, were
travelling on Lampang-Chiang Mai route when it hit the pachyderm walking on
the road near Khun Tan hill in Hang Chat district at around 10pm on Friday,
said police. The bus was operated by state-run Transport Co.

The force of the crash killed the elephant on the spot. Bus driver Narit
Jittrong, 45, was badly injured and trapped in the driver’s seat.

Rescue workers took more than one hour to extricate the driver from the
wreckage. He was rushed  to a nearby hospital, while other passengers on
board were not injured.

Pol Col Virot Saeng-iem, deputy investigation chief at Hang Chat police
station, said an investigation found that the elephant was on the loose
from its shelter and was walking on the road during the crash. The bus was
going up Khun Tan hill at the time and the driver could not see the
elephant walking in the darkness, causing the bus to crash into the animal.

The elephant,‘’Plai Udom’’, 8, was under the care of the Elephant
Reintroduction Foundation, which was about to release the animal into Doi
Phamuang wildlife sanctuary in Hang Chang before the crash. The pachyderm
was in the stage of adjusting itself before being returned to the forest.

The jumbo earlier broke loose on Sept 8 this year and was found searching
for food at a roadside forest near Khun Tan highway service unit.",1

MYSURU:  The number of elephants that fell to bullets has risen to three in
the last two months as a 35-year-old male elephant was found dead with
bullet injuries at Hadya village near Hediyala in Nanjangud taluk on Monday.

The body was found in the sugarcane field belonging to one Basavaraju. The
elephant had been shot in the upper abdomen, legs and chest.

Forest officials suspect the killing to be the result of growing angst
among farmers in the forest fringe villages. The ivory of the animal which
might have died a day or two ago is intact.  The man-animal conflict has
gone up in recent days at Hadya, Hediyala, Eregowdanahundi, Hanchipura,
Indiranagar, Maduvinahalli, Kandegala and neighbouring villages that are
close to Bandipur National Park.

During the last fortnight, herds of jumbos were found going berserk in the
agricultural fields of these villages destroying crops worth lakhs.

Efforts of the Forest Department to drive the jumbos back into forest had
helped little as the wild guests were finding their way into the villages
again.

In Madikeri

Madikeri: Kasheeshawari (40), a resident of Guhayya village from Siddapura
was killed by a wild elephant when she was working in a  coffee state on
Monday.

In Belagavi

Belagavi: Jumbo terror has struck again in the villagers of Chunchawad and
surrounding areas, causing heavy losses for farmers in Khanapur taluk in
recent days.  A herd of six elephants, including two calves, have now
camped in the sugarcane fields of Chunchawad village, forcing the farmers
to stay away.

KRISHNAGIRI: An elephant sustained minor injuries and one of its tusks was
broken after a Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation bus knocked it down
near Krishnagiri on Wednesday.

According to forest officials, a herd of three elephants came out of the
forest and tried to cross the Chennai-Bangalore National Highways near
Kundarapalli.

""Two jumbos managed to cross the road. A tusker, which came behind the two
elephants, suddenly turned back and moved towards the bus,"" a forest
official said.

Bus driver P Kumaresan, 38, tried his best to avoid the vehicle hitting the
elephant, but in vain. The bus knocked down the tusker.

One of the tusks of the elephant got broken in the accident. The elephant
sustained minor injuries too. Officials said the broken tusk weighed around
3.5kg.

Kumaresan, who suffered injuries, was rushed to Government Hospital in
Krishnagiri.

The bus was going to Hosur from Chennai. There were more than 40 passengers
on board the bus.

Traffic on the Chennai-Bangalore National Highway was affected after the
accident.

Forest officials were monitoring the injured elephant, which moved to the
banks of a nearby lake.

A rogue elephant that killed four persons in the last three days in Purnia
district of Bihar was shot dead by Hyderabad sharp-shooter Nawab Shafath
Ali Khan and his team of forest officials on Saturday morning.

The 35-year-old tusker strayed into Bihar from Nepal four days ago and
created havoc in some villages of the district.

On Wednesday, a teenager was killed by the elephant, while three others
were trampled to death in the following two days.

On Saturday, the tusker killed another person and damaged a house.

“We tried to tranquilise it and translocate it. But it continued to destroy
property and kill people.

It was moving towards human habitations and posing a risk. Finally, on
instructions of the forest officials who were accompanying me, I shot it
with a .458 Winchister Magnum bullet and it collapsed. It was inevitable,”
Mr. Shafath Ali told The Hindu over phone from Bihar.

A team of trained mahouts from West Bengal were also assisting their Bihar
counterparts and forest officials for last two days to translocate it. A
few thousand villagers had also gathered in the village outskirts to
prevent the tusker from moving into the villages but to no avail, he
explained.

P.K. Gupta, Regional Chief Conservator of Forest and District Forest

‘extermination’ (Bankura, India)
Aniruddha Ghosal, The Indian Express
February 7, 2016

An elephant who knocked down six villagers, killing two of them, in Bankura
district in the past two weeks has been dubbed “killer” by the state forest
department which has assigned a team of two hunters to “exterminate” the
animal. Somnath Mukherjee, deputy conservator of forests, confirmed that
“the order to exterminate the rogue animal has been issued.”

A migrating herd of 72 wild elephants from the Dalma have entered the
Bankura forests in the past few months and split into two groups, officials
informed. The resulting conflict isn’t limited to just human casualties
with five elephants dying from electrocution in January. Most recently, an
adult tusker was electrocuted in Lalbazar under Barjora forest range on
January 30 when it’s trunk touched a high-tension electric wire.

On February 3, the “killer” elephant had attacked Gopal Lohar (72) at
Ramharipur jungle while Ashish Mondal (26) died after being attacked by the
elephant in Kukrajhar village, officials said, and added that Mondal’s
friend Hanuman also suffered injuries and is battling for life at the
Bankura Sammiloni Medical College and Hospital.

In a separate incident in February, which the forest department believes is
also linked to the same elephant, the dead body of Ashish Mondal (27) was
found near a pond at Kanchanpur beat. An elephant had been spotted at the
scene of crime.

Pinaki Mitra, DFO, Bankura (North) said the hunt for the rogue elephant
began soon after the order was given on Wednesday by chief conservator of
forests, Pradip Shukhla. Two hunters – Ritesh Chakraborty and Rajkumar
Mukherjee – have been hired by the department for this purpose.

At the heart of this conflict lies the Dalpani Kankrajhor elephant
corridor, documented after a four-year-long survey, ‘Right of Passage’
published by the Wildlife Trust of India in association with the Union
government’s National Elephant Corridor Project documented elephant
corridors in the country. The survey found that Bengal has the maximum
human population along with the highest degradation and fragmentation of
forest, leading inevitably to extremely high numbers of man-elephant
conflict. The survey said the corridor that elephants use to enter Bankura
from Dalma is “threatened by expansion of agricultural land near Amlasol
and nearby villages”.

The survey noted: “This is the most frequently used elephant route. Every
year elephants from Dalma pass through various degraded forest patches and
enter the Kankrajhor Reserve Forest from where they move to Bankura and
Purulia. They enter Kankrajhor near Amlasol village.”

Forest department officers said in the past 11 days alone, the rogue tusker
attacked six villagers. “Prima facie it appears to be a young bull who
recently entered adulthood. His tusks are smaller than others. It has an
injury to his ear which causes him excruciating pain and is the reason for
the unusually high level of aggression,” an official informed.

“After an unsuccessful first day, the two hunters set out looking for the
rogue animal in Gangajalghanti and it’s adjoining Barjora Forest areas
early Saturday morning. But they’re yet to find the animal,” said another
official Saturday evening.

Officials admitted that the unusually prompt decision to dub the animal as
“killer” and the order for his death was linked to a similar case in
November 2015, when another elephant had killed four people in Bishnupur,
Bankadaha and Sonamukhi range in Bankura. “The animal was unsuccessfully
tracked for four days and the killing stopped only after the herd was
pushed away by another herd from Dalma ranges in Jharkhand,” an official
said.

But in spite of the rapidly escalating man-elephant conflict in Bankura,
the threats documented by the survey in 2004 continue to worsen and forest
department officials said little work had been done to relocate villages in
the area, as had been suggested by the 2004 study.

“The survey had suggested the declaration and legal protection of the
corridor while seeking alternatives for Amlasol and Makali villages. But
with rise in population, most of the land in what were once forests have
been converted into fields as a result of which the deaths – of both human
and animal – have also increased,” admitted an official.",1

Two elephants were found dead at a farm in Gerua village, some 12 km from
here, on the foothills of Dalma wildlife sanctuary early Monday morning.
Mystery shrouds the deaths of the elephants, whose carcasses were found
concealed in the bushes.

According to sources, though the exact cause of the deaths could not be
ascertained immediately, forest department suspects that the animals may
have consumed pesticide or electrocuted. The department is waiting for the
autopsy reports of the elephants, aged about 35 (female) and 10 (male).

“We are investigating as to what led to their death. These are not natural
deaths, but as per the initial probe, it seems that the elephants might
have consumed pesticide. However, it will be too early to draw a
conclusion. We are waiting for the post-mortem report,” Dalma range officer
R P Singh said.

The officer, however, did not rule out electrocution. “It is really sad to
know about the death of our elephants. We will take help from local
villagers, some of whom are members of the Van Samity (forest committee),
to find the motive behind the incident,” he stated.

Dalma divisional forest officer Kamlesh Pandey, who visited the spot, said
that viscera samples will be sent to the forensic laboratory of animal
husbandry department in Ranchi. ”We are waiting for the forensic report of
viscera only then things will be clear,” he said.

The post-mortem of the elephants was conducted in the afternoon at the farm
itself by a government veterinary doctor from Patamda in East Singhbhum.

Local villagers assisted him in the exercise. Later, the elephants were
buried there with help of a crane. Sources informed that the abdomens of
both the elephants were swollen.

Local villagers, including women, assembled at the farm as the news spread.
Some women smeared vermillion on the trunks and foreheads of the dead
elephants.

Some also placed coins on the carcasses and performed their customary
rituals.",1

A 10-year-old elephant died trying to save her calf which was caught in an
electric fence in Tamil Nadu's Vellore district this morning. Both mother
and child were electrocuted.  The Assistant Conservator of Forests,
Mohammad Raffi  in Vellore said, ""High voltage electricity on an illegal
electric fence put up by a private farm is responsible for this. This
technically comes under the Krishnagiri Forest Division.
We have informed our colleagues there. They will investigate.""

No arrests have been made yet. Investigators are looking for the man who
had taken the land on lease.

A few days ago, a herd of three elephants including the two that were found
dead today was seen roaming in the area and local people had complained of
crop damage.

While solar electric fences with very low power supply to emit just pulses
that keep animals away, officials say the fence that killed the elephants
this morning was connected to high voltage power.

Sampath, President of the Velakkal Natham Panchayat, said, ""(The)
authorities should ensure this does not repeat.""

Elephant deaths due to illegal electric fences are treated on par with
poaching. Officials say it appeared the calf got stuck in the live fence
first. The mother tried to lift it and got electrocuted.

In January 2012, the Madras High Court had directed the state environment
and forests department to remove illegally erected solar and electric
fences in the elephant corridors. An appeal against the order was dismissed
by the Supreme Court. But, farmers continue to put up illegal fencing.

In Tamil Nadu electric fences kill more elephants than poachers. The
elephant is a protected animal under wildlife laws and included in other
species like the tiger and lion in Schedule I of the Wildlife Protection
Act.",1

The forest department has deployed 20 staff members at the Madukkarai
forest range to take care of a 10-year-old male elephant that sustained
injuries in its mouth after biting a crude explosive planted to scare away
wild boars.

Forest department officials said they spotted the elephant on September 28
at Nathegoundanpudur forest area in Madukkarai forest range. When they
found that it was wounded, forest range officer M Senthilkumar and his team
immediately made arrangements for providing medical help to the animal.

""We saw the elephant near a water tank. We gave the animal some medicines
mixed with water. We also fed the jumbo banana leaves and fruits,"" M
Senthilkumar said.

The officials also said it was difficult to approach the elephant to
provide treatment, as was roaming with another male elephant aged around 25.

Conservator of forest I Anwardeen said the elephant's lower jaw was found
swollen and there was an inflammation in the oral cavity. The animal's gait
is normal and seen running. However, his aggressive playful acts may hurt
the oral structures.

found from Dhupguri area of Jalpaiguri district this morning, forest
department officials said.

The adult male elephant had entered the field area which was surrounded by
high voltage electric wire. It came in contact with live wire and was

An adult tusker was electrocuted at Duramari in Dhupguri block's Moraghat
range. The incident took place on Monday.

The elephant had raided a potato field near the village near Khuttimari
forest. The field located at Kerani Para in Duramari belongs to one Dhwajen
Adhikary, who had allegedly hooked power from high tension line and laid
the open wire on the ground to prevent the jumbos from raiding , said a
forest official.

The elephant died on the spot on coming in contact with the wire.

On Monday morning, villagers of Duramari saw the carcass of the elephant
lying on the field electricutedwith electric wires on its trunk. Primarily
Foresters are certain of electrocution. It was the villagers who informed
the forest department about the incident. ""The signs on the body indicated
that the elephant died of electrocution. The department has lodged an FIR
against the land owner,"" honorary wildlife warden Seema Chowdhury said.
Dhwajen is on the run from police.

Tapping of power from high tension wires and laying of electric traps for
jumbos is a common practice in this part of the state, especially in Dooars
and Terai. People living in the forest villages and on the fringe areas do
this to stop elephants from sneaking into their habitat and paddy fields,
especially during the time of harvesting.",1

In a heinous incident, two elephants comprising a mother and her calf were
electrocuted to death near a village at Choudwar under Cuttack Forest
division on Saturday night.

The mother and calf came in contact with live wire as they strayed into the
agricultural fields at Dihasahi village adjoining Athagarh forests. The
wire was drawn from Pahalibar village in Khuntuni and fixed to bamboo poles
around 50 acre of farmland.

According to Forest officials, the act was undertaken under the garb of
solar fencing to protect the crop land from jumbo incursions which has been
a menace in the region. Earlier, the Forest Department had supported
installation of solar fences to keep animals and livestock away from
agriculture land.

But in this case, the wire was found to have been drawn by hooking into the
high tension line and extended through a length of more than 700 metres.
The jumbos, apparently, tried to cross through at around 3 am and sustained
such strong shock that they succumbed on the spot.

In solar fences, the shock is delivered in pulses and stops after one jolt
which is enough to deter the animals. But here, the electricity flow was
continuous that resulted in death of the animals. What is of more concern
is that the wire was drawn without any technical understanding and hung in
low height. The elephants bore electrocution mark beneath the stomach.

While the Forest Department has lodged a case under Wildlife Protection Act
and started investigation, it is also set to seek assistance of electricity
supply company to ascertain where the line was hooked.

In another incident, a juvenile elephant was found dead at Majhipada
reserve forest under Tikarpada Range on Saturday night. The elephant, aged
four to five years, was apparently suffering from disease and had been
abandoned by the herd. It succumbed on Saturday. Its tiny tusks were found
in tact.

Though there are no signs of foul play, the cause of death is being
verified, Forest officials said.",1

Two wild bull elephants, each about 10 years old, were found dead near a
well in a rubber plantation in Kaeng Hang Maew district on Monday night, an
official said.

Pitak Yingyong, chief of a forest protection unit in the Khao Ang Rue Nai
game reserve, said he and district police went to the rubber plantation of
Supatra Kangwan, 31, on Monday night.

They had been informed about the dead elephants by the chief of Moo 10
village in tambon Phawa.

They found the two male elephants lying dead near a well.  They were
believed to have died about seven days previously.

Mr Pitak said the two animals might have been electrocuted as there was a
line to the well to power a light and a water pump.

and makhana was trying to cross Chettipalli Reserved Forest to Sanamavu
Reserved Forest by crossing Krishnagiri to Hosur National Highway. At that
time a SETC bus from Kumbakonam to Bengaluru was on the way and when

In 2003, five jumbos knocked down by  train while crossing railway track at
Periyanagathunai near Rayakottai. Similarly, in 2013 two more elephants
died in the same place by hitting train  while crossing the track.

A 25-year-old tusker was killed after it came into contact with an
illegally electrified fence around a private agricultural land near the
reserve forest at Moolakadambur village here on Thursday. This was
reportedly the forth jumbo death reported in the district over the past
three weeks.

Forest officials have arrested the land owner for setting up the electrical
fence illegally. The arrested was identified as P Thangavel, 25, of
Moolakadambur village. ""He installed the electrical fence without obtaining
permission from the forest as well as the Tamil Nadu Electricity Board
(TNEB),"" officials said. He told us that the fence was set up to protect
his farm produce from wild animals, they further said.

The agriculture land was located near the Kadambur section of TN Palayam
forest range. On Thursday morning, villagers found the carcass of the
tusker near Thangavel's farm and immediately alerted the forest department
officials. They then reached the spot and initiated an inquiry. The forest
officials said the tusker was entangled in the fence. ""It received burn
injuries on its neck, truck and front legs,"" they said.

The forest officials arrested Thangavel based on his confessional statement
under various sections of the Wildlife Protection Act. They later produced
him before the Andhiyur sub-court, which remanded him in judicial custody
at Erode prison.

The veterinary doctors, meanwhile, performed autopsy and sent the animal's
vital organs for laboratory analysis. The tusks were also removed and taken
to the TN Palayam range office.",1

November 4, 2016

Even during a weekday, groups of curious onlookers attempted to make their
way into the fenced area of Machanabele dam.

The cynosure of all eyes, sympathy and attention was Sidda, a 35-year-old
injured tusker. Curiosity, however, has kept personnel of the Department of
Forests and the local police on tenterhooks. They want to make sure the
elephant is attended to despite the large crowds that come to take photos
or to feed the animal, or perform rituals to “aid its recovery”.

Since it fell into a ditch near Dodderi on the outskirts of Bengaluru on
August 30, the elephant has spent more than 55 days on the banks of the
reservoir. However, for the past 12 days, it has been immobile and writhing
in pain. This, however, has not deterred the crowds. During the Deepavali
holidays, police officials said, over 3,000 people, including Kannada film
actors, local politicians and visitors from Bengaluru and Mysuru, turned up.

On Thursday, more groups of people came, and Cauvery Neeravari Nigam Ltd.
officials, who have fenced the land around the reservoir, struggled to keep
them from entering their gates. “I’ve been seeing the elephant in the news
and felt like I had to see it,” said Ganganayya, a daily-wage labourer from
Nelamangala who had come with two of his friends.

Forest officials said the crowds had become a major hindrance to the
elephant’s treatment.

“They insist on feeding him or do pujas close to the elephant. They take
photos with the flash on. Many touch the elephant out of curiosity or for
blessings ... as crowds swell on holidays, it is becoming difficult to
treat the elephant,” an official said.

A tusker aged around 35 years was found shot dead in the Hunsur wildlife
range of the Nagarahole National Park in Mysuru district on Saturday. The
carcass was found close to Hoskere and post-mortem indicated that the
bullet had pierced its left front forelimb and penetrated the lungs before
getting embedded in the heart.

There were scratches and bruise injuries on its back and hence it was
initially suspected to have died in a fight with another male. But
post-mortem ruled it out when a bullet was found in the heart and was
removed, according to veterinarian Umashankar. It is more likely that the
elephant was part of a larger herd and the bruise marks may have been
inflicted when the animals ran helter-skelter following the firing, he
said.

The Nagarahole Park Director H.C. Kantharaj said it was not a case of
poaching but of a conflict situation as they suspect a farmer to have
opened fire during a crop raid.

A complaint has been filed with the police and the authorities have named a
farmer suspected to have opened fire at the herd. The elephant had dragged
itself from the field to a distance of 250-300 metres before collapsing in
the forest. Mr. Kantharaj said the suspect was absconding and the police
have launched a manhunt to nab him.

This is the first such incident reported from Nagarahole in recent times
though elephant deaths due to electrocution was common in the region.

Nagarahole national park supports more over 1,000 elephants and is part of
the Mysore Elephant Reserve where the elephant densities are high. But
conflicts are also acute in the region and it was only recently that two
elephants were captured by the Forest Department in the adjoining Kodagu
district to reduce their frequent foray into human landscape.

A major portion of the Nagarahole boundary has been solar fenced but this
is no barrier for elephants to move out as the Elephant Proof Trenches
(EPT) and solar fence circumvent the physical boundary of the forests while
elephants follow their ancient migratory pattern along what were once their
natural habitat but have been converted to agricultural tracts over the
years.",1

Hundreds of villagers in India gathered together to mourn the death of an
elephant that died after being electrocuted when it wandered into community
looking for something to eat.

People decorated the elephant's body with paints and plants as part of
prayers as it was laid to rest and buried in a massive grave on Sunday at
Chakrapani village in the Kamrup district of Assam, India.

Local reports claim the massive mammal was killed after coming into contact
with one of the community's unauthorized electric wires especially erected
and hidden by the villagers to keep away the wild elephants.

It is understood the Asiatic elephant had strayed near a storehouse where
it had attempted to eat some paddy rice when it inadvertently touched the
high voltage fence.

An official said that the scarcity of food and the illegal encroachment of
forest areas nearby may have forced the wild beast to desperately seek out
food in a populated area.",1

suspectedly by persons from inside a vehicle. He said that the
elephant was frequently sighted by motorists standing along the road
side in the forest stretch.

The tusks of a young male elephant, aged around 20 or 22 years, that was
killed after it came in contact with live electric wires near Talakona in
Chittoor district were removed for safe keeping by forest officials. Later
the carcass of the tusker was buried.

The tusks will be destroyed after the incident report is sent, along with
the post-mortem report, to the AP chief wildlife warden, divisional forest
officer of Tirupati, Subba Reddy said.

He said this measure was to prevent people from digging up the elephant's
body for the valuable tusks and selling them. Possession or sale of
elephant tusks is a serious crime under the Wildlife Protection Act. ""The
elephant died on Monday after it came in contact with three live electric
wires that were hanging just about seven feet above the ground. The animal
was about nine and a half feet tall and was about a year or two away from
reaching breeding age and is a big loss,"" Subba Reddy said.

As soon as we got the information on Monday, we rushed to the spot and
conducted a post-mortem, he added. The forest department, he said, also
sought an explanation from the electricity department as to why the supply
lines were left hanging so low.

The young bull elephant was a loner and must have strayed out of the Sri
Venkateswara Wildlife Sanctuary by taking a route over a stream, he said.
There is another local herd of about 25 elephants in the area that includes
five calves, Subba Reddy said.

Normally, some of the elephants leave the forest and enter the
eco-sensitive area in the 10 km radius, especially around summer during the
mango season. Though the season of the fruit is now over, the herd is still

Earthmovers closed in on a patch of forest in West Bengal's Bankura
district to dig the ground as the beast lay motionless. This morning, smoke
was seen rising from the area. A full-grown male elephant, shot dead with
no less 12 bullets after a dangerous chase, was being cremated.

The elephant had been killed last night after tranquillisers failed to
bring the tusker down. The chase had involved drones, five teams and nearly
cost one senior official his life after the elephant turned aggressive and
charged at the teams.

The elephant had been declared a rogue last year after it killed at least
one person and destroyed several homes in Bankura district.

Its killing comes a month after union minister Maneka Gandhi, famous for
her activism in animal rights, had said that the West Bengal government had
got permission to kill wild elephants from the environment ministry.

These comments came when 200 Nilgai were killed in Bihar. At that time West
Bengal authorities had stoutly denied that it had sought clearance to kill
but confirmed that it had sought permission to capture 18 wild elephants
which had claimed 71 lives in South West Bengal in since April last year.
35 of the deaths had occurred in Bankura.

On Monday, wildlife officials launched drones in the Bankura forest of
Beliatore. Once the cameras spotted the two elephants, five separate teams
were moved towards them. A smaller eight foot tall elephant was
tranquillised and captured but the bigger tusker showed no signs of slowing
down despite being hit by several darts.

""Yesterday wildlife officials again launched an operation to capture the
elephant but after being darted 7 times the elephant turned aggressive and
attacked the Hulla party and officials. One senior wildlife official Sujoy
Ghosh was almost trampled to death. At that time wildlife officials decided
they had no option but to shoot the elephant dead,"" Pradeep Vyas, chief
wildlife warden, West Bengal said.

""It has never been our intention to kill. We in fact got five elephants
from Nor6th Bengal to Bankura to help in the capture of rogue elephants but
it did not work. We had not option,"" he added.

A wild elephant was found shot dead in a farm land bordering the forests at
Athirattukunnu under the Pathiri South section of the South Wayanad forest
division Sunday morning.

Forest officials said that the male elephant was around 20 years old and it
had three gunshot injuries in its body.

The killing has ringed alarm bells among forest officials and
conservationists as it is the third elephant to be gunned down in Wayanad
district in the last six months.

The carcass of the elephant was found lying in the paddy field by locals
early morning. Forest officials led by South Wayanad divisional forest
officer Abdul Azeez reached spot at 7 am. Steps are on to conduct the
autopsy.

The latest killing comes close on the heels of the arrest of a resort owner
in the last week of October for shooting down a wild elephant in
retaliation against the action taken by forest officials against his resort.

Locals said that there have been isolated incidents of crop raiding by
elephants in the region.",1

Sam Paul A, The New Indian Express

Ringed by coffee bushes, orchards, pepper vines and wild woods, Thithimathi
is a scenic town in Kodagu district. However, the serenity is only seeming.

A long walk away from the town’s bus stop is Devamachi, a village of less
than 25 families. It is surrounded by coffee plantations with spiked gates
and solar-powered fences. The once great forest has been reduced to patches
of wild green interspersed between the plantations. A deep trench separates
the woods from the path we take.

Inside one of the plantations stands a wild elephant browsing on the
bushes. It radiates belligerence, brushing against a tree trunk, and
trumpeting repeatedly, a ‘do not disturb’ signal.

The village farmers are not happy about this visitor and want him gone. But
for the elephant, this stretch falls under his traditional migration
corridor and it is his territory. And now he wants it back. “They should be
culled,” says a farmer, his voice tinged with resentment.

This is the classical human-elephant conflict (HEC), a phenomenon in which
both sides suffer huge losses, but there can only be one winner – man.

 grand theatre of man-elephant conflict: p6Back in June, a man was trampled
to death by an elephant in the middle of  Thithimathi town. A few days
later, two elephants were shot dead by unidentified people. They were
retaliatory killings.

A further 150 km from Thithimathi is the plantation of the Tamil Nadu Tea
Plantation Corporation Limited at Kolapalli near Gudalur in Nilgiris
district. Kolapalli division is home to a large number of Sri Lankan
expatriates who work and live in the tea estate. This region too is a grand
theatre of the human-elephant conflict.

Both Thithimathi and Gudalur fall in a 12,600-sq km area of forest and
protected spaces which hold the single largest contiguous population of
Asian elephants, some 7,000 individuals.

It is the most important elephant landscape in the country. It envelops the
entire Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve (NBR) and straddles the three states of
Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Kerala. Crop raids by elephants, human lives lost
to marauding pachyderms and retaliatory killings of elephants by means of
gunshots, electrocution and poisoning are routine here.

According to available data, more than 100 elephants have been killed as a
result of HEC in the three southern states in recent years. Twenty five
deaths were reported due to electrocution in Tamil Nadu alone. As many as
300 human lives have been lost to Human Elephant Conflict (HEC). Many of
the planters here keep licensed guns.

“The conflict will continue as long as there is human presence in the
natural habitat of elephants. Whatever we do is inadequate,” declares Y K
Kiran Kumar, forest ranger of the Mathigodu range under Thithimathi
division.

Recent studies suggest that new areas are being sucked into the conflict
zone, fuelled by insufficient resources in the forest, fragmentation and
degradation of the habitat, increase in the local elephant population and
corridor loss. The human-elephant relationship is not beyond repair, as
ranger Kiran Kumar might suggest, but it has definitely reached a low. HEC
now represents the primary threat to the survival of the Asian elephant, a
globally endangered species.

Approximately Rs 1,500 crore has been spent over the past 10 years in three
southern states to check the human-elephant conflict by building trenches,
solar fencing and elephant walls, without much success. Unless effective
mitigation measures are taken, the prospect of south India without
elephants is a medium-term possibility, conservationists say.

The Asian elephant (Elephas maximus) was once widely distributed throughout
the country, including in states like Punjab and Gujarat. Currently, it is
found in only 14 states, in four fragmented populations.

An adult elephant was electrocuted in Birpara area of Dooars in the
early hours of Saturday.

Before getting the fatal jolt the jumbo had raided a paddy field in a
village next to Dalgaon forest. On Saturday morning, The villagers on
Saturday morning found the carcass of the elephant inside a betel nut
plantation, just beside the paddy field and informed the Dalgaon
forest range. Locals informed the Dalgaon Range immediately after the
discovery.

The signs on the carcass made the foresters believe that this was a
case of electrocution. From the signs on the carcass, foresters
primarily believe this to be a clear case of electrocution. ""We'll
take legal steps against the owner of land where the carcass washas
been found,"" said a forest official.

Tapping of power from high tension wires and laying wire traps for
jumbos are a common practice in region of the statepart of the state,
especially in theDooars and Terai. People living in the forest
villages and in the fringe areasdo this to stop elephants from
invading paddy fields during the harvest season.

""There should be a balance in death and human-elephant conflict should
be stopped. Every time an elephant dies, we feel sad. We have to come
up with ways to stop this,"" said chief minister, Mamata Banerjee in
Kolkata. Over the past few years.

The practice has also gained popularity among villagers in Baundangi
area of Nepal's Kakarvitta. which is often raided by elephants that
cross over from the Mechiriver on the Indo-Nepal border. and enter
into the village.In Bengal, 19 jumbos have died due to electrocution
in the Dooars and Terai in 10 years. Recently, a daily labourer died
in Belakoba area after coming in contact with a wire that was laid
down as an elephant trap.that the owner of the landhad laid on the
ground to stop elephants from entering his field.

Environmentalists blame it on the indiscriminate growth of habitats in
and around forestlands, which the governments have so far failed to
put a check. ""Since their land has been occupied, they have started
raiding. Having their land occupied, elephants The behavioural change
in the elephants is also a result of the continuous man-elephant
conflict,"" said Animesh Basu, a member of state wildlife advisory
board.

A 40-year-old tusker that died at a reserve forest on Tamil Nadu-Kerala
border, despite the last minute treatment given by Kerala forest department
officials could have been killed by a bullet injury, suspect a joint team
of experts from the two States who conducted the post mortem examination on
Saturday evening.

The wound behind its right ear, estimated to be about a month old, was
small but deep - about a foot and half and cut its shoulder bone. “It was
in pain, there were several litres of pus that we took out of the wound,”
said Shaji Panikkasserry, senior veterinary surgeon from Mannarkadu in
Kerala, who conducted the post-mortem examination along with his colleague,
surgeon Abubucker Siddique aand M Jayanthi, veterinary doctor from
Anaikatti in Tamil Nadu.

The infection from this wound entered its blood - septicaemia - and killed
the elephant, said the doctors.

“There was only that one injury, which we suspect might have been caused by
a bullet. But we did not recover any bullet,” Shaji added. After finding it
wounded, the animal was being tracked by the Kerala forest department,
sources told Sunday Express. On Friday morning, it was tranquilised by
veterinary surgeon Arun Sakaria with the help of Tamil Nadu forest
department. They treated it for the injury after sedating it, and a team of
anti-poaching watchers from Periyanacikenpalayam forest range monitored its
condition till late night even after releasing.

The efforts, however, went in vain, with the animal found dead about 200
metres away from Bhavani river, inside Gopanari reserve forest in the range
on the border on Saturday morning.

The district forest officer (DFO) in charge A Periyasamy visited the spot
to carry out investigation. As mandated by rules, representatives of an
NGO, Osai, were present during post-mortem examination jointly carried out
by the Kerala and Tamil Nadu forest departments.

The wound was not caused during fight with another bull elephant as was
suspected initially, ruled the veterinarians after the examination. This
has raised questions about suspecting poaching in the contiguous forest
range that is spread across both States. “We cannot rule out poaching in
these States. Last year, for instance, officials in Kerala had recovered 50
kgs ivory from a gang,  which confessed to have poached  the animal in
Coimbatore,” said environmentalist K Mohanraj.

“We have anti-poaching camps in remote areas that has made the district
safe. But such facilities are not available in Kerala. Anyway, we will wait
for the report from the veterinarians to conclude whether the elephant died
due to bullet injury,” Periyasamy said. Mannarkadu DFO was not be reachable
for comments. Last July, the Union Minister had sought an explanation from
State Forest Department over alleged lack of adequate measures to protect
the Edamalayar forest range where poachers gunned down five elephants.",1

A female elephant was electrocuted in forests of Dharamjaigarh in Raigarh
district after coming in contact with 11 KV high voltage live wire due to
its low height on Monday evening. While forest department officials claim
that they had alerted electricity department to makeshift the low-lying
wire, there was no action taken which later became the reason of elephant's
death.

The incident took place at Chuhkimar forest at Kharsia in Chaal forest
range where a body of female elephant was found. According to information,
the elephant came in contact with high voltage wire leading to its death on
the spot due to electrocution.

The wire was hardly three metres above the ground which anyway posed danger
for both animals and human but officials said that despite informing the
electrical department, no attempts were made to shift the wire.

Villagers could inform forest department about death of elephant only after
a day when the body started staling. It was buried after autopsy. In the
past, such incidents have taken place when locals have purposely laid such
live wires to bother elephants and many tusker have died due to

A female elephant died of bullet injuries on the outskirts of Bengaluru on
Wednesday.

The officials suspect that the wounds could have been inflicted by either
poachers or a estate owner.

The animal was found, bleeding severely, near the Kodihalli forest range
near the Bannerghatta National Park on Tuesday, sources at the Forest
Department said.

They suspect that the pachyderm might have been shot near Neralatti Kere
near the Karnataka-Tamil Nadu border. There were bloodstains at different
places between Neralatti Kere and Byalamara, sources added. Following the
incident, the Forest and Police Department officials have initiated a joint
investigation.

The post-mortem was conducted and the carcass was burnt at the spot.

Most waterbodies on the elephant corridor, from Male Mahadeshwara Hills in
Chamarajanagar district to Savandurga Range in Ramanagaram district, have

In a major breakthrough, the SSB has arrested a poacher suspected to be
behind the killing of a semi-adult elephant four days ago. The poacher,
Bipul Sanu Oraon, a resident of Nararthali in Buxa Tiger Reserve in
Alipurduar’s Kumargramduar block, is a major catch for the forest
department. A leopard skin along with a motorcycle was also recovered from
him.

On July 8, forest officials recovered the body of a headless half-grown
elephant near the Rydak River in Tiamari beat. It was thought the tusker
might have died near the Bhutan border, which is nearby.

Poaching of wild animals has become a major concern for forest officials.
In recent years, there has been sharp rise in cases of poaching. A few
locals are actively involved in it as it is very easy way to make huge sums
of money. At least seven elephants have been killed in north Bengal over
the past few years, with six rhinos killed in Jaldapara alone. Two years
ago, a rhino was killed by poachers in Gorumara National Park, the first
such incident in 22 years.

Conservationists blame lack of personnel for the consistent poaching of
animals in north Bengal. According to Animesh Basu of Himalayan Nature and
Adventure Foundation, the forest department has a staff shortage of 36 per
cent at present.

With the arrest of Bipul Oraon, forest officials are trying to find other
poachers operating in the area. (EOIC)",1

A group of anglers in Kedah state recently chanced upon an unwelcome find
on their way to Pedu Lake: the remains of an elephant. The dead pachyderm
had had its tusks removed in what seemed to be a professional manner. The
animal was likely killed by poachers for its tusks, officials suspect.

The culprits probably waited for an elephant to emerge from a nearby forest
so as to quench its thirst before they ambushed and killed it. Owing to the
relentless heat because of the El Nino phenomenon, “wild animals such as
elephants emerge from the jungle to drink water at the lake,” a local
official explained.

And so there you have it: unscrupulous people, out for a quick buck on the
illegal wildlife market, continue killing endangered animals, which can ill
afford to lose any more of their members. Elephants are high on the list of
endemic species that are facing a growing threat of extinction in the wild
in Malaysia.

Only an estimated 2,500 Bornean pygmy elephants (Elephas maximus
borneensis) remain. To make matters worse, the species is facing a
dangerous genetic bottleneck because of the fragmentation of their
habitats. As a result, wild elephants are becoming increasingly prone to
the risks of inbreeding with attendant health problems.

Scores of wild elephants are also facing immediate risks of being killed
for trespassing into vegetable gardens and oil palm plantations. In 2013 an
entire herd with 13 mature adults were found dead in the Gunung Rara Forest
Reserve in the south-central part of Sabah state. The animals had all been
poisoned, possibly by oil palm cultivators.

Conservationists have just issued an online petition calling on the
government to protect endangered wild elephants from being poisoned or
otherwise harmed. Oil palm cultivators, the animal rights activists say,
routinely place rat poison around palm trees to prevent pachyderms and
other animals from feasting on their fruit.

Meanwhile, poachers and game hunters carry on decimating endangered
species, elephants among them, any chance they get. “[A]nything that roams
the wild, slithers on the ground and nests on the jungle canopy is fair
game for these heartless hunters,” one commenter has put it. “Their mindset
is, the rarer of species, the better the game. Is there, then, any hope for
wildlife to survive?”

There is … but only if we all do everything within our power to stop
poachers, hunters, poisoners and the myriad other defilers of Malaysia’s
forests.",1

A female elephant and her calf got electrocuted due to low-hanging
high tension wire inside the core area of Rajaji Tiger Reserve. The
cow got electrocuted when her raised trunk came in contact with the
wire while the calf was touching her, leading to their deaths in the
Haridwar range of the reserve.

The sighting of the carcasses after three to four days of the incident
also raised questions over patrolling by forest staff. Dinesh Uniyal,
range officer, said a forest team traced the carcass of mother and
baby elephant from the stench.

Rajiv Mehta, honorary wildlife warden of Rajaji has raised his
concerns saying that had the patrolling practice been done regularly
then the team would not only have known about the sagging high-tension
power lines but also have spotted the carcasses much earlier.

Meanwhile, the electricity department has also come under the scanner
for keeping the wire dangling allegedly at an height of 13 feet, in
contravention to the stipulated height of 17 feet inside the reserve.
The forest officials have lodged a case against Meeruth Koteshwar link
engineer of the power department.

Sources said that at many places inside the reserve high-tension wires
can be seen at low heights. Most of these are old wires or have sagged
from climatic conditions like heat and swaying from strong winds.

Over two years ago, another elephant was also electrocuted outside the
Rajaji reserve.

Director of Rajaji Tiger Reserve, Sanatan denied fault on part of the
forest staff. ""There are only 147 forest staff to patrol hundreds of
kilometres in Rajaji. So, it is not possible to keep a track of every
site on daily basis.""

The ailing tusker which was rescued in a critical condition from Asurakhol
in Odisha’s Deogarh district died on Saturday while undergoing treatment.

According to reports, the elephant was found in Tileibani forest range with
deep injuries on his head. Veterinary experts were called in and the
pachyderm was under supervision of a team of specialists from Odisha
University of Agriculture and Technology (OUAT) since Monday in Asurakhol
village under Prabhasuni Reserve Forest range in the district.

However, he slipped into coma last night and succumbed after battling for
life for nearly a week.

The jumbo was rescued from a nullah with the help of a crane and was under
treatment since then.

During post-mortem, a 7.5 cm arrow was removed from the head of the
elephant which suggests that poachers might have shot him.

Meanwhile, Forest Department officials have launched an inquiry into the
matter.

It may be mentioned here that at least five elephants have died in the last
four months in this particular region.",1

NARATHIWAT: Forestry officials and veterinarians tried in vain on Friday to
save a wild elephant wounded by gunshots near an orchard where she had been
looking for food.

Soldiers led a group of officials and animal doctors into the jungle on Mao
Tae mountain in Rangae district after villagers informed security
authorities about the wounded elephant.

They found a female lying on the ground suffering from several gunshot
wounds to her head and left rear leg that had left her unable to stand.

Veterinarians cleaned the wounds and injected a saline solution as part of
the effort to save her life but the elephant finally succumbed to her
injuries.

Villagers told Wirote Siriumakul, the chief of the Chaloem Phrakiat
Wildlife Conservation Office, that the elephant had come down from the
mountain in search of food at a local fruit orchard before she was shot.

The beast had come down with a male elephant and their baby, both of which
returned to the jungle, he added. It is not known who fired the shot at the
animal.

Chonsawad Boonkua, an official with the conservation office, reported the
incident to the Rangae police and asked that they find the shooter.

Villagers who learned of the fate of the elephant took uncooked rice to the
scene and spread it around her to bid their final farewells before she was
laid to rest in the area.

A wild elephant was found dead lying on an uncultivated land in Gudai
village near Kalyanpur Police Station recently.

Symptoms show that the animal might have died due to poisoning by pesticide
given by the villagers.

Ratan Debbarma, a local villager, told ANI: ""We noticed a herd of around 12
to 14 wild elephants including a calf in the eastern Gudai village area. We
tried to scare them away but failed. This morning we came to know that an
elephant was lying dead there. We don't know how it died.""

The forest officials along with veterinary surgeon are conducting an
autopsy to find out the actual cause of death.

District Forest Officer (DFO) Pritam Bhattacharjee said, ""The elephant is a
sub-adult male and is around four years old. I came here along with the
veterinary surgeon after we got the information from the locals. Only after
completion of the veterinary examination, we shall dispose the body as per
the guidelines. The veterinary surgeon felt that it may be a case of
poisoning. He has collected blood, tissue and organ samples for
investigation.""

The attack on wild elephants in Kalyanpur area is quite rampant and every
year just before the harvest of paddy and other crops, especially during
the dry season, when there is a crisis of food and water in the jungles,
herds of wild elephants enter the cultivated fields and destroy crops
leading to conflicts within the locals.

Earlier also, there have been reports of death of elephants mainly due to
electrocution in Kalyanpurarea.

A female elephant and her calf were found dead in a paddy field in
Mayurbhanj district on Saturday. The carcasses of the elephants were
spotted near Niyuti village under Gurguria forest range of Karanjia
division. While the female elephant was aged about 20, the calf was only
three months old. Though the cause of their deaths was yet to be
ascertained, preliminary reports indicated that they might have died of
poisoning.

A group of veterinary officials from Karanjia and another veterinary team
from Baripada jointly conducted an autopsy. Assistant Conservator of Forest
(ACF) Baidyanath Majhi said the autopsy report is awaited.

Tension prevailed in the area as forest officials arrived late despite
prior intimation. According to locals, forest officials were intimated on
Friday night after they heard screams of the pachyderms in the field, but
none came to their rescue.

The villagers said a herd of elephants from neighbouring Jharkhand had been
wreaking havoc in the area by damaging paddy crops in several acres of
land. They suspected the farmers might have applied pesticides in the paddy
fields to ward off the pachyderms and the mother and calf might have eaten
the poisoned paddy plants.

Some forest officials, who visited the spot, were of the opinion that the
death of the elephants might have been due to anthrax, as blood stains were
found in their urine and stool.

Karanjia DFO Prasanna Kumar Behera said it would be difficult to decide on
their cause of death as no injury mark is spotted. “We are waiting for the
autopsy report to know the exact reason behind the twin deaths,” he added.",1

after coming in contact with an illegally installed electric fence. The
forest officials have taken one person into custody in connection with the

Anthrax has been ruled out as the cause of death of the female elephant
whose carcass was found in Sirumugai Range in Coimbatore forest division on
Monday.

Animal husbandry department veterinarians in Chennai confirmed to TOI that
the blood samples taken from the dead elephant showed no strains of anthrax.

Wildlife veterinarian N S Manoharan, on deputation to the forest
department, had earlier informed the media that the animal died due to
anthrax. A senior veterinary officer conceded that the vet had jumped the
gun by issuing the statement before the blood test was carried out.

The same vet had failed to detect the pregnancy of a female elephant a
couple of months ago in the Coimbatore region and was giving treatment for
an ailment before it delivered a calf.

Wildlife activists believe the elephant was poisoned citing previous
instances. A large number of banana farms have appeared illegally in both
Sirumugai Range in Coimbatore and the adjoining Bhavani Sagar Range in the
Sathyamangalam Tiger Reserve. The farmers target elephants that stray close
to their farms by lacing ba nanas and jackfruits with poison, they said.
The activists blamed forest officials for not taking action against the
encroachers despite being aware of the violations.

When contacted, chief wildlife warden V K Melkhani said following reports
of increased elephant deaths, he was inspecting Aanamalai Tiger Reserve in
Pollachi and other areas in the region. Asked specifically about the cause
of death of the elephant, Melkhani said he had not seen the report yet,
adding that elephants die due to drought conditions in many parts of the
state.

A high level committee from the Union Ministry should inspect the spot and
conduct a postmortem to bring out the truth behind the animal's death,
wildlife activists said.\",1

Two elephants were electrocuted to death in Karanji village under
Tangi-Choudwar block within Cuttack Forest Division limits on Sunday night.

The two female elephants aged 15 and 10 years respectively came in contact
with live wire after they strayed into Srikhetra Garden located on the
premises of Sri Maa Aurobindo Ashram under Safa Section of Dalijoda Forest
range, Bairi.

The electric wires were drawn illegally from the house of two persons
staying inside the Ashram, said DFO Sudarsan Patra.

The jumbos succumbed on the spot. The bodies of the pachyderms were found
lying separately at a distance of 100 metre inside the garden.

On being informed, Forest officials rushed to the spot and conducted an
enquiry. The bodies of the elephants were buried after postmortem.

The Forest Department has lodged a complaint against Radhakanta Panda and
Dharani Dhar Pal, the two persons from whose house the electric wires were
drawn illegally, under Wildlife Protection Act.

Officials of CESU have also launched a probe into the illegal extension of
electric wires which led to electrocution of the two jumbos.

On March 20, a mother elephant and her calf were electrocuted at Dihasahi
village near Choudwar within the limits of same Safa Section in Dalijoda
range of Cuttack Forest Division.",1

An elephant calf died after it was rescued by a team of Kaziranga National
Park and forest officials from the Bhomoraguri Reserve Forest here, a
forest official said on Tuesday.

The two-year-old elephant was tranquilized and safely rescued, but it died
in a vehicle on way to the rescue centre yesterday, Rathin Barman, Director
of the Elephant Rescue Centre of the Wildlife Trust of India at KNP, said.

The baby elephant was severely injured in the stomach as confirmed by the
post-mortem, Mr Barman said.

West Sonitpur Divisional Forest Officer (DFO) Diganta Borbora said the
elephant had crossed the river Brahmputra from the Kaziranga National Park
(KNP) and took shelter in the Bhomoraguri Reserve Forest before it was
traced on Sunday.

According to the rescue team, they guarded the pachyderm in the night

A tusker was electrocuted when it tried to enter a farmland at
Kanchenahalli in Sathanur hobli, Kanakapura, 60 km south of Bengaluru, on
Thursday night.

Nagesh had erected an electric fence across his farmland to prevent wild
animals destroying the crops. On Thursday night, a 50-year-old elephant
strayed into Kanchenahalli. When it tried to enter the farmland, its tusk
brushed the fence and the animal was electrocuted, police said.

The incident came to light on Friday morning when villagers spotted the
dead elephant. They called the jurisdictional Sathanur police. Forest
officials arrived at the spot and conducted the post-mortem.

Based on a complaint filed by forest officials, police have booked Nagesh
for illegally erecting an electric fence. They are trying to trace him as
he has absconded.

On December 7, a tusker died from bullet injuries near the Kodihalli forest
range. Forest officials are chasing stray tuskers back to the forest.

Noted animal rights campaigner, Heritage Animal Task Force has demanded a
probe into the frequent deaths of wild elephants inside
Athirappilly–Vazhachal forests in Thrissur district, about 260 kms from
Thiruvananthapuram. In the last 17 days, carcasses of five wild jumbos with
wounds all over the body, have been found inside the forest area, the HATF
said in a letter sent to Director of Project Elephant, under the Union
Ministry of Environment and Forest.

The Thrissur-based outfit also enclosed the photo of one of such wounded
carcasses along with the letter, which was released to media. HATF
secretary V K Venkitachalam said in all the five cases, the lower level
forest officials, ranging from Range officer to Forest Guard, supervised
the post mortem of such carcasses.

“It is in violation of a state government order dated September 10, 2015,
which specifically states that the conduct of the post mortem of any
carcass of protected wild species surfaced inside forest area must be done
only in the presence of Chief Conservator of that territory,” he said in
the letter.

Such an order was issued by the government after the revelation of a
poacher that his gang had killed 21 tuskers from forest areas of
Athirappilly,Vazhachal, Edamalayar, Pooyamkutty and Mathikettan in the
state during the period between 2011 to 2013, it said.

The then State Forest Minister Thiruvanchur Radhakrishnan had directed the
Forest Secretary to issue the G.O. “But for the past 17 days, all the
carcasses of five elephants were subjected to post mortem without the
physical presence of the central circle conservator of Thrissur who have
office at Paravattany which is only 40 kms away from the Athirappilly-
Vazhachal Area,” he alleged in the letter.

The campaigner also stated that the viscera samples of the dead animals
were not sent to the Hyderabad-based Centre for Cellular and Molecular
Biology, to verify the actual cause of its death. The forest department was
yet to conduct any formal inquiry into this type of serial deaths of wild
elephants inside a forest area which was developed using crores of money
granted by UNESCO, he said adding a comprehensive probe should be conducted
into the incidents.",1

NAGAON (HAIBORGAON), Dec 24: Another wild jumbo on Friday midnight died of
electrocution in the paddy field of Nagaon Narttamgaon village near
Puranigudam in Nagaon district due to alleged extreme negligence of the
Nagaon Divisional Forest Official and APDCL workers, which has drawn
reaction from all sections of the society.

Interestingly, a large herd of wild jumbos entered areas like Barhampur,
Narttamgaon, Bherbheri, Putani Bhutaigaon, Gumuthagaon, Bakultal and
Pathari and had demolished various houses and also destroyed hundreds of
bighas of paddy over the past 20 days. But the forest officials allegedly
failed to send back the herd to the jungle due to alleged extreme
negligence of the Divisional Forest Officer. As a consequence, soon after
the electrocution of the jumbo on Friday midnight, an irate local mob on
Saturday morning thronged the spot and went on a rampage and in presence of
DFO Dipika Chuodhury.

The mob alleged that the incident took place because of her indifference
and negligence. The mob even staged protest against the indifference and
negligence of DFO Choudhury and other forest officials. Subsequently, the
mob also slammed the power department and alleged that wires of the old
power line were hanging loose and all these years no steps had been taken
to repair these old power line.

Later, higher officials of the district police administration and district
administration rushed to the spot and managed to bring the situation under
control and also managed to protect DFO Choudhury from the irate mob. The
mob even opposed the burial of the jumbo till the officials of APDCL
promised to repair the old power line within a stipulated time. Meanwhile,
the local MLA and former Chief Minister P K Mahanta also rushed to the spot
and took the feedback of the whole incident and urged the district forest
officials as well as the APDCL to take immediate measures against free
movement of wild jumbos in the areas and appealed to them to provide proper
protection of the jumbos as well as the inhabitants of the greater area of
Barhampur.",1

KOTA KINABALU: Conservationists entered the New Year in shock as a Borneo
pygmy elephant with unique “sabre” tusks was found brutally killed.

The elephant had actually been rescued from a plantation in Tawau three
months earlier and fitted with a satellite collar as part of efforts to
monitor its movements.

The animal's skeletal remains were found in the Segama conservation area on
the eve of New Year, hardly a week after another elephant was found dead in
the same area.

The remains of the sabre-tusked elephant were found on Saturday.

In a Facebook post on Sunday, the Danau Girang Field Centre (DGFC) said
that based on information from the satellite collar, the unique
sabre-tusked elephant might have been killed on Nov 20.

The elephant’s remains and the satellite collar were discovered on Saturday
morning.

When contacted DGFC director Dr Benoit Goossens said the remains were found
by a DGFC and Wildlife Rescue Unit team about 1.5km away from where the

PATTAYA, Thailand, Jan 5 (Reuters) - A baby elephant took a tentative dip
in a swimming pool in Thailand on Thursday as part of a lengthy
rehabilitation process to heal her injured foot.

Baby Fah Jam was three months old when her front left leg was caught in a
trap set by villagers in Chanthaburi province, 250 km (155 miles) southeast
of the capital, Bangkok.

Veterinarian Padet Siridumrong said Fah Jam, who is now five months old,
was showing signs of improvement following initial water-based exercises
known as hydrotherapy.

""By her fourth or fifth sessions she will enjoy swimming more. She's just a
baby, that's why she's a bit scared at first but, by nature, elephants love
the water,"" Padet said.

The treatment could take up to two months, he said.

The elephant is a symbol of Thailand and in ancient times they were used to
carry soldiers into battle. They were also used in the logging industry.

But logging has been banned and many domesticated elephants have ended up
on the tourist trail, giving rides and putting on displays in shows.

Animal rights groups have criticized the use of elephants in the tourism
industry, arguing that the animals are often mistreated.

There are about 3,700 elephants left in the wild in Thailand and up to
4,000 domesticated ones, according to EleAid, a British organisation
working for the conservation of the Asian elephant.

Deforestation, rapid urbanisation and poaching of elephants for their ivory
have all contributed to a dramatic decline in the wild elephant population.",1

A 25-year-old female elephant was shot dead by two men in Ulipanda village
on the fringes of Jawalagiri reserve forest on Monday night.

The animal was found dead with two bullet injuries on its forehead on
Tuesday morning by the locals, who alerted the officials. The elephant was
part of a small migratory herd from the North Cauvery Wild Life Sanctuary
that stretches from Karnataka to Tamil Nadu.

The accused, whose identity was not known, were from the same village and
had allegedly indulged in wild boar hunting in Ulipanda in the past.
Hunting of wild boars is an offence in Tamil Nadu, though the Central
government has declared the species to be vermin in a few States.

On Monday night, the accused A.Basavaraj (34), son of Anumadhappa, and his
friend T.Madesh, son of Thimmarayappa, were reportedly waiting in a tomato
field. Basavaraj had taken the land adjoining the tomato field on lease for
cultivation.

When the duo and three other men were waiting for the wild boar, they
spotted the elephant grazing afar. Basavaraj allegedly used his
country-made gun to shoot down the elephant.

On Tuesday morning, a team consisting of officials from the Forest
Department, including Conservator of Forests, Dharmapuri, Ashish Kumar
Srivastava, District Forest officer, Hosur, Rajendran, along with Hosur Sub
Collector Senthil Raju, accompanied by the police reached Ulipanda on
receiving the alert from locals.

The Forest Department has booked the men under Section 9, 39 and 51 of Wild
Life Protection Act, 1972, and under Section 25(1)(A) of the Indian Arms
Act 1959; and under Section 9 B (1) (b) Indian Explosive Substance Act ,
1908.

The police arrested Madesh and picked up two others in the village, while
the prime accused, Basavaraj, is not traceable.

‘Firing unprovoked’

Mr. Srivastava told The Hindu that the accused could not have shot the
elephant in “self-defence” as there were no signs of aggression.

A Revenue Department official similarly, said the the accused had taken
time to aim at the head of the elephant that was grazing at a distance.

A parallel report will be submitted by the Revenue Department to the
government.

The three-tonne elephant could not be shifted along the difficult
unmotorable terrain of the village. Hence, an autopsy was conducted on the
spot and was buried at the same spot.

Quite a few instances of shooting with illegal country-made guns in Thally
and Denkanikottai area were reported over personal enmity.",1

COIMBATORE: The carcasses of a 30-year-old female elephant and its
six-year-old male calf were found in a farmland at Thasampalayam in Tamil
Nadu on Tuesday morning.

Forest officials said the elephant and its calf were electrocuted when they
came into contact with an electric fence in the farmland, situated near
Nellimalai reserve forest in Mettupalayam forest range, on Monday night.

A one-and-a-half-year-old calf that suffered injuries was rescued and sent
for treatment.

The land belonged to Palanisamy. The farmer had kept the electric fence to
prevent the entry of wild boars.

District forest officer Ramasubramanian, Mettupalayam forest range officer

Sujay, 45, a male kumki elephant attached to Chadivayal elephant camp lost
its tusk after attacked by a wild elephant in the early hours of Wednesday.
Forest Department officials said that Sujay could have been attacked by a
wild elephant in musth (an aggressive behaviour born out of urge for
biological ventilation).

The incident happened around 4.15 a.m. when the a lone tusker trespassed
into the compound of Chadivayal camp, breaking the fencing. Though eight
forest staff were present at the camp, Sujay, who was chained, was badly
attacked by the lone tusker. The right tusk of the kumki which came off
from the root was found on the ground. The lost tusk had a projected length
of three feet.

“After hearing loud trumpeting sounds, our staff chased the wild elephant
using crackers and torches. The wild elephant, a gigantic one aged around
40 and 11 feet tall, must be in musth as it broke the electric fencing to
enter the camp and attacked the kumki,” said C. Dinesh Kumar, Forest Rage
Officer, Booluvampatti.

Following the incident, Forest Department officials rushed to spot and
administered medicines to Sujay. Senior forest veterinarian N.S. Manoharan
checked the injury of the elephant and managed to arrest the bleeding.

“Sujay has been administered injections to heal the wound and antibiotics
to prevent infection. We will be closely monitoring his health in the
coming days,” said Dr. Manoharan.

According to forest officials, the elephant is taking food and water after
treatment. Following the incident, six more forest staff have been deputed
at camp which also has another kumki named Pari (36). The forest officials
are also observing the movement of the tusker that attacked Sujay.",1

Two elephants including a calf captured by the forest department, died due
to different reason here on Wednesday. It may be noted that two elephants
were electrocuted on Tuesday after coming in contact with live electric
cable at a farm land near Mettupalayam.

In the first incident, a seven-year-old female elephant, which was getting
treatment at Seeliyur in Periyanacikenpalayam forest range, died around 3
am on Wednesday.  According to sources, the animal’s tongue was cut and
right leg was fractured after biting an ovuttukai (country-made bomb) kept
by farmers to protect crops from wild boar. “Though we administered more
than 45 bottles of IV (glucose) to improve its health the animal died
around 3 am on Wednesday,” said S Palaniraja, forest range officer of
Periyanaickenpalayam range.

NS Manokaran, forest veterinarian, who performed the postmortem on the
elephant said that the animal was severely injured and had infection on its
mouth and right leg.  “We have drained litres of puss from the animal’s
leg, stomach and mouth. It’s stomach was empty. The animal was suffering
from the injury in the last two weeks.”

In another incident, a two-year-old elephant calf that was injured on
Tuesday after coming in contact with a live electric cable near
Dasampalayam village near Mettupalayam, died within an hour after
veterinarians carried out surgery to the calf.

Two veterinarians, Asokan of Sathyanangalam Tiger Reserve and Prayag of
Karnataka, were providing treatment to the calf elephant inside the forest
depot on Kotagiri road near Mettupalayam. According to forest sources, the
animal had a deep injury on its trunk and was unable to consume water on
its own.

“The forest department should not have captured the calf even though it was
injured badly. Also, the department delayed the treatment. They should
discuss with the NGOs working in the field,” said N Sadiq Ali, founder of
Nature Conservation Trust.

The calf elephant along with its mother and another calf entered a farm
land, owned by Palanissmy at Dasampalayam near Mettupalayam on Tuesday
early morning, where they came in contact with the live electric cable.

With this, four elephants have died in a 10 km radius at Mettupalayam in
less than 24 hours.",2

The carcass of a sub-adult female elephant was found in an agriculture
field near Garda village under Bisra range of Rourkela Forest Division on
Wednesday. The elephant is suspected to have been electrocuted.

Divisional Forest Officer (DFO) Sanjeet Kumar said, the female elephant may
have come into contact with the 44 KV overhead line and died. It appears
that the overhead wires were sagging and the elephant’s trunk got
entangled, he said adding autopsy of the carcass would be conducted on
Thursday.

The villagers of Garda, part of Nuagaon block, prevented the forest
officials from shifting the carcass demanding safety measures in place from
a herd of eight elephants which has holed up at adjacent Bandega Reserve
Forest (RF). They also demanded immediate payment of all outstanding
compensation claims of elephant depredations.

Assistant Conservator of Forest JK Mohanty said, efforts were underway to
convince the villagers to relent. A squad would guard the carcass during
night while another would chase away the herd.  With this, the number of
elephant casualties in Rourkela division has reached four in six months. An
elephant calf died on October 6, 2016 after it got stuck in a puddle near
Sonaparvat under Panposh range. The same day, another newborn died after
drowning in an open well at Riu of Kuarnmunda range.

A lone tusker which has been roaming the forests of Athagarh with an
injured leg has managed to keep Forest sleuths at bay for the last five
days. Attempts to track the jumbo for tranquillisation has failed too.

But what is a matter of concern is that a front leg of the elephant has
been trapped in a tyre. Unable to free itself, the jumbo has been moving
around the forests with the tyre which has started to injure its leg.

Athagarh Forest Division which had sought assistance of experts from OUAT
and logistics support from Nandankanan Zoo had located the elephant on
Tuesday and Wednesday but could not tranquillise it. On Friday, the jumbo
could not be traced while today, it was located only during the evening due
to which tranquillisation was ruled out. The forest officials are likely to
resume the operation on Sunday.

Since the left leg has been trapped in the tyre for about a week, sources
said, the elephant has been hurt. Any delay in tranquillising the elephant
may prove risky for the jumbo. In the wild, elephants find support from the
herd but this being a loner, the animal has struggled.

What has not helped the matters is the manner in which the Forest
Department has approached the whole exercise. Instead of trying to locate
the jumbo quietly, the forest staff have made matters worse by allowing
locals who have been trailing them. Sources said the team has even been
accompanied by media persons.

""The whole exercise should be carried out in a discreet manner without
raising any attention because that disturbs the animal. An enraged elephant
is most likely to vanish from the location,"" said a forest official.
Interestingly, on Tuesday, the local forest staff had been charged by the
jumbo and some of them sustained injuries too. Wildlife experts say
elephants give mock charge when they find too many people following them
and that should have been avoided in the first place.

""The forest staff must follow the standard operating procedure which the
Ministry of Environment and Forest and Climate Change had issued for such
scenario.

The first measure should be to cordon off the area with help of police and
if necessary, clamp prohibitory orders. It is hardly followed,"" said an
expert.

However, Athagarh being a political sensitive place neither police nor
forest officials are willing to take on the locals. With panchayat polls
drawing close, none is willing to take any risk.",1

Despite alertness of forest authorities, another elephant has died in West
Bengal's Midnapore. Only recently, an adult male elephant was found dead in
the woods.

According to villagers and forest department officers (FDO), two elephants
in Goaltore village got into a fight over intrusion into their territory.

While one elephant was shot dead, the other which was injured died after a
few days in Lalgarh village.

The elephant's body was sent for post-mortem. The autopsy report revealed
that the causes of death were the fight between the two animals and the
eating of pesticide crops.

The toll of elephants in Midnapore and Rupnarayanpur divisions this year
has risen to 10, while a total of 4 elephants have died in Lalgarh.

CONSUMING OF PESTICIDE REMAINS MAKES ELEPHANTS ILL

The consuming of pesticide remains in crops makes elephants ill, causing
their death.

In earlier years, elephants coming from Jharkhand's Dalma area in search of
food used to return to their home territory. Later, they started dwelling
near the villages which began posing a security hazard for villagers.

The quantity of crops destroyed in a year because of the straying of
elephants is immeasureable. This has not only hurt the farmers
economically, but also terrified families staying in villages, as several
people have been trampled by the animal.

Indrajit Das, a villager, described the incident and the fear it has
triggered among the people. ""The elephant died two days ago, perhaps due to
ill health. As it fell down on the ground, it suffered major injuries. This
year four elephants and around 100 people have died. There are 100
elephants going amok all over the forest. This is what we are scared of.""

WHAT DOES THE DFO HAVE TO SAY

Despite the villagers blaming forest departments for not taking the
responsibility to rein in the pachyderm menace in villages in East
Midnapore district, Divisional Forest Officer (DFO) Rabindranath Saha
explained the cause of deaths of elephants. ""Around 10 elephants have died
in one year. The problem that occurs when all elephants gather in one place
is that they start fighting among themselves. The male elephants,
especially, fight among themselves over food and capturing of their land.
Earlier, when elephants used to come to the village, they used to go back
but now they don't move out of the territory. Elephants coming from the
Bankura side are staying in our Midnapore area for the rest of the years.
The cause of the death is supposed to be the fight among elephants. It is a
case of survival of the fittest"", said the DFO.

If the forest department does not control the situation at the earliest,
the toll of both elephants as well as villagers will increase.",1

In what could be another major loss for the UT Administration, a legally
employed forest tusker is battling for life in the Middle Andaman region.
Mattu served for more than 15 years in the Department of Environment and
Forests, but when the  latest machinery claimed importance, official
indifference started taking lead in our system. If sources are to be
believed, Mattu was found in ‘Musth’ stage last month, but Veterinary
doctors administered wrong medicines following which the elephant
contracted serious infection.

According to information, Mattu was found in the ‘Musth’ stage last month
after which the veterinarians administered some medications. From the
January 26, the tusker developed serious infections on his male organ. As
per the present condition, staff  of the Forest Department are trying their
best to bring the elephant to normalcy. Tied with sacks and other
unsterilized clothes, official apathy is evident . This apathy is under
heavy criticism from the local population here, who have lived for years
with our mammals.

Speaking to this correspondent, the Pradhan of Sundergarh Panchayat, Mr
Biju Gurudasan again demanded proper care for the forest tuskers. “Such
deficiency in care of our nature friends should not happen. I wish Mattu
good health and his recovery as soon as possible. The government machinery
should ensure proper care of friends without any laxity,” says Mr Gurudasan.",1

Despite 45-year-old Champa, an elephant, being in the last leg of her life,
it hasn't stopped residents of nearby villages showing that even in one's
final hours, showing kindness can go a long way irrespective of whether
it's a man or beast.

Residents bring something or the other for the pachyderm lying on the banks
of Narmada in Kasrawad area of Khargone to eat. Champa's mahout failed to
feed her or get her wounds treated, which has led to her critical state.

""The way they have been feeding and taking care of the elephant is
remarkable,"" said SD Malha, sub divisional officer, forest department,
Khargone.

Experts feel that any effort now will not be fruitful as the animal was not
taken care off when it needed it the most. ""The condition of the animal
showed that it had not eaten properly for several days. It was dehydrated.
We gave it medicines but we don't see much hope,"" said Dr Uttam Yadav, zoo
in charge, Indore.

Champa had apparently travelled a long distance in the last few months.
According to Ram, the mahout, he had come from Katni via Vidisha and
Mandleshwar. While they were travelling long the banks of the Narmada,
Champa suddenly fell and was unable to get up again.

""It seems that the elephant has been standing for more than a month. It has
some problems in its joints. When such animals do not sit for such a long
time, the possibilities of getting up once they fall is negligible,"" said
Dr HK Mehta, associate professor, department of medicine, Veterinary
College, Mhow.

Since Champa had only been been lying on one side of her body, her blood
circulation was badly affected, Mehta added.

""In most cases the mahout and the elephant's owner do not have proper
knowledge about certain problems that tuskers sometimes have. Over time
these problems compound and these sorts of situations arise,"" Mehta said.

While doctors confirmed the elephant's condition was due to negligence, no
case has been registered in the matter.

Forest department officials said they had checked with the owner of the
elephant and he had all necessary papers. ""The elephant is registered in
Rajasthan. The owner had proper permission. At this stage it is not right
to claim that the condition of elephant deteriorated due to negligence and
that it was not taken care of properly,"" Malha said.",1

treatment.

An elephant which had been regularly eating garbage at Manampitiya died
last Saturday after suffering from a sickness for a month.

This well grown male, about 20 years of age, was part of a herd that fed on
garbage from a dump at Manampitiya. It had fallen ill in the third week of
January. A veterinary surgeon and a team of wildlife officers tried to
flush out any non-digestive materials from its stomach. One even inserted a
hand through its anus to manually pull anything that remained. At first
they pulled out about 15 kilograms of polythene in a day and over a month
about 30 kilograms were removed.

Dr Pramuditha Devasurendra who had treated the elephant, rejected the idea
that the polythene was the cause of death. He said toxic bacteria in
rotting food may have been the cause. “The garbage pit contains lots of
lunch sheets with rotten food. Deadly bacteria can grow on the food. This
is main reason for the death of the elephant.”

Dr Devasurendra revealed that a post-mortem did not find any polythene in
the bowels of the dead elephant. Its liver and spleen were damaged.

He said he had treated another elephant about half a kilometre away from
the garbage dump at Manampitiya. “That elephant too died and I have been
unfortunate to witness deaths of at least 10 elephants since I assumed
duties in this area four years ago,” Dr Devasurendra said.

The Manampitiya dump is not the only one that attracts elephants. A garbage
dump in Dambulla attracts elephants. Yet another dump in Hambantota is
protected by an electric fence.

Dr. Devasurendra said an electric fence was needed at Manampitiya.

Meanwhile, Dr Prithiviraj Fernando, estimates that there are at least 50
locations where elephants come to forage at the dump. They are mostly in
the dry zone.

Dr Fernando said piles of vegetables, over ripe fruit, flour, rice, bread
and the like are more nutritious than what is found naturally. Elephants
which rummage for these at the dumps are in better health, he said.

But he said every day 500 elephants may be eating garbage. “In a year, how
many of them would die as a result? How does this compare with other
‘unnatural’ causes of elephant deaths? Such as being shot, hakka patas,
injuries from trap guns and nooses, train or vehicle accidents, starving to
death inside parks after being driven in and restricted with electric
fences,” he asks.

It is mostly adult males living outside Wildlife Department protected areas
that eat garbage.

This also means the elephants are not raiding farms. So if they are to be
prevented from raiding garbage dumps would it increase the human elephant
conflict, and how many of them would be injured and killed? And how many
people would be injured and killed? Dr Fernando asks.

“So before jumping in and trying to ‘fix’ something one should first find
out what the problem is, figure out the cost and benefit of ‘fixing’ and
make an informed decision. Otherwise the cure may be worse than the
disease,” he warns.

Dr. Fernando suggests separating the organic matter from the plastics,
metals, and glass materials before being dumped.",1

 A female elephant carcass was found near Bhadramunda village under Khamar

elephant have died after coming in contact with an 11kV live wire late last
night while venturing into the fields of the villagers to eat ?moong? crop.

According to the Khamar range forest officials, the elephant aged around
20-22 years must have come in contact with a low-lying overhead 11kV live
wire which got snapped and laid beside the body of the elephant.

The forest department officials are examining the exact cause of death.

remain sagging at many places, for which, the elephants  come in contact

A park ranger in Cambodia says an endangered wild elephant has died after
an electrical pole fell and electrocuted the animal.

Nup Thet, a ranger at Wildlife Alliance, said the 3-ton elephant was
electrocuted late Tuesday in the jungle near Cardamom National Park.

Cambodia is home to some 450 wild elephants. Suwanna Gauntlet, chief
executive officer of Wildlife Alliance, said about 200 of them live in
Cardamom National Park.

Last July, a wild baby elephant died in northeastern Mondulkiri province
after becoming snared in a poacher's trap in the jungle. The death raised a
red flag for many conservation groups concerned with the ability of local
authorities to protect the endangered species.",3

A female adult elephant that stuck in the slush of a waterhole at
Kunjurpathy in the forest periphery near Periyanaickenpalayam in Coimbatore
rural was rescued after a five-hour-long struggle on Saturday. Soon after
the rescue, the lactating mother elephant rushed to its calf that was
roaming nearby and breastfed it.

The elephant, aged between 45 and 50 according to Forest veterinarians, was
was part of a three-member herd.

“The elephant was found exhausted and was unable to move from the slush
where it could have stuck in the later hours of Friday or early hours of
Saturday. The calf and other elephant was roaming around the fallen mother
elephant. The calf was spotted having milk from the fallen pachyderm in the
morning. They were later chased to a safe distance to start the rescue
operations,” said District Forest Officer S. Ramasubramanian.

The rescue works started around 8.30 a.m. under the supervision of senior
Forest veterinary surgeon N.S. Manoharan, Mr. Ramasubramanian and C. Palani
Raja, Range officer, Periyanaickenpalayam. Officials initially pulled out
the elephant from the slush to the bed of the pond. It was given 50 bottles
of saline solution, 20 injections of essential drugs like antibiotics,
vitamins and other energy boosters.

According to Dr. Manoharan, the elephant was so exhausted that it did not
scare people who were treating it for hours. Fruits and fodder were fed to
the elephant in its mouth as the animal could not to move its trunk.

With help of excavator, Forest department officials created a slope from
the place it was laid down for treatment. Around 1.30 p.m. the animal
slowly slid its body through the slope and stood on its legs as its energy
level was stabilised. After standing in the place for around 30 minutes, it
walked off to the forest and breastfed its calf that was roaming around.

“Before walking off to the forest, the elephant came close to the entire
team and literally watched every person as if a mark of gratitude. It did
not try to chase people or trumpet to scare,” said N.I. Jalaluddin of
Nature Conservation Society, who was at the spot.

Dr. Manoharan said that the elephant's dung has high presence of parasites
which could be one of the reasons for having exhausted and fallen in the
bank of waterhole. The lactating elephant also had diarrhoea.

Mr. Ramasubramanian has directed anti-poaching watchers in the range to
observe the elephant for a few days to track its health condition.

Elephant found dead

Meanwhile, a three-year-old male elephant with its tusks intact was found
dead in Segur section in the Nilgiris. Investigations are on.

The personnel of the forest department on Friday administered
antibiotics to a seven-year-old lone female elephant and a
three-year-old male elephant suffering from bacterial diseases in
Coimbatore forest range. A team, led by forest veterinarian NS
Manoharan, darted the elephants with medicines.

The female elephant, found roaming alone in Thippanur near Pannimadai
during night hours, was affected by bacterial infection in its mouth.
Though a team from the department had attempted to treat the elephant
a few days ago, it chased them away. They later decided to administer
medicine by remote injection.

Meanwhile, the officials approached the ailing elephant with fruits
mixed with medicine. ""We placed fruits mixed with medicines near a
gated community area at Thippanur some days ago and the elephant was
not hesitant to eat it,"" said S Ramasubramanian, district forest
officer (DFO), Coimbatore forest division.

The personnel darted it on Friday night. ""The antibiotic drug will
cure the wounds in its mouth. We have been providing medicine-laced
fruits for the last five days and noticed improvement in its
condition. It would recover completely soon,"" Ramasubramanian told
TOI.

The three-year-old male calf was in a herd seen at a brick kiln unit
at Veerapandipudur near Thadagam. ""We administered medicine to the
elephant calf also using a dart. The health condition of the animal
has improved,"" said Ramasubramanian.

The chief conservator of forests (CCF), I Anwardeen, congratulated the
field staff for conducting the treatment. ""It was a very risky
operation. Thanks to our staff, the two animals are recovering from
the ailment. We have taken dung samples for analysis. The animals are
affected by unfavourable weather, ecological stress, lower immunity
and inbreeding depression,"" he told TOI.

Only rains and fresh pasture availability in the natural habitat can
improve the health of the wild animals, Anwardeen added.

Meanwhile, Ramasubramanian blamed man-animal conflict for the spread
of bacterial infections among wild animals. ""There is acute water
scarcity in the reserve forest. When villagers take cattle to the
forest area for grazing, the domestic animals drink from the water
resources inside the forest. Due to this, bacterial infections spread
to the wild animals,"" he said.",1

death on Friday after it smashed six houses and frightened villagers after
tromping out of the Mondolkiri province forest into which it had fled
earlier this week, officials said.

The elephant, Toak, had charged out of the forest on Thursday afternoon,
“but we managed to scare him back into the forest using fireworks,” Jemma
Bullock, program manager for the Elephant Livelihood Initiative
Environment, which sought to help the villagers, said on Friday.

to death in Mondolkiri province on Wednesday. (Mondolkiri Provincial Police)

Overnight, while authorities were waiting for a team of veterinarians with
tranquilizer guns to arrive from Phnom Tamao Wildlife Rescue Center “the
elephant came out of the forest again and returned to the village. He was
really aggressive and clearly still in the signs of musth,” or mating
behavior, she said.

After its death, the elephant’s owners removed its valuable ivory tusk,
fearing others might try to take it, she said. Photographs later surfaced
on local media, leading readers to fear the animal had been hacked to
death, but this was not the case, she said.

“He smashed down six houses and was completely uncontrollable,” she said.
“Police and a fire truck came to help, and were firing warning shots and
trying to scare him back to the forest. But when he kept attacking the
house one police officer fired on his leg to stop him.”

The elephant went down about 1 a.m. and died an hour later, she said.

Kan Peng, police chief of Sen Monorom City, confirmed the death, saying it
was necessary because the elephant had “killed a human and destroyed
property” and the rescuers were taking too long to respond. He said the
elephant was buried.

The saga began on Wednesday when the elephant, out for a walk with
tourists, attacked and trampled his mahout, or handler, 45-year-old Choeung
Tieng, near Katang village in Sen Monorom City’s Romnea commune. The
incident was attributed to the elephant being denied an opportunity to mate
during the rutting season.

After the attack, the elephant had run into the forest with a female
elephant. “The female was recaptured by her owners Friday morning,” Ms.
Bullock said.

With the death of the elephant Perinjanam Sekharan, the death toll of
captive elephants in the State has touched eight so far this year.
Twenty-six elephants had succumbed to various illnesses and torture last
year.

Sekharan was the 34th elephant to die within the past 16 months. Sekharan
succumbed to liver infection, says V.K. Venkitachalam, Secretary, Heritage
Animal Task Force.

“The elephant was a victim of experimental and ineffective treatment. This
is the fourth captive elephant to die in the State within the past 36 days.
At the time of death, the blind elephant was kept at a place where there
was no statutory shelter shed. This elephant was one of the 427 elephants
kept by illegal elephant contractors without having statutory ownership
certificates,” Mr. Venkitachalam said.

Another elephant, Channanikkad Neelakandan, died at Pavaratty on April 10.

The elephant was suffering from foot disease and impaction.

Frame protocol

The Heritage Animal Task Force urged the Kerala State Forest Department to
frame a protocol to conduct diagnosis and treatment of elephants in
captivity and to conduct post-mortem in a scientific manner.

In case of elephant deaths, post-mortem must be conducted by a team of
pathologists, who were not part of the treatment team. Moreover, the
viscera should be preserved and sent to accredited centres for statutory
forensic tests, it demanded.

Against directive

Meanwhile, in a letter to the Secretary, Animal Welfare Board of India,
Chennai, and Director, Project Elephant, Ministry of Environment and
Forest, the task force alleged that the elephant Parassala Sivasankaran
that killed its second mahout Murugesh at Parassala on Thursday was kept by
the Travancore Devaswom Board without ownership certificate. “The Animal
Welfare Board of India had directed the Forest Department two years ago to
initiate urgent steps to rehabilitate that elephant into their elephant
care centre. The Forest Department is yet to implement the order.” It urged
the authorities to take steps to shift the elephant to the care centre.

NAINITAL: A day after a tigress was found dead in the Ramnagar forest
divisionnear Corbett National Park, the carcass of an elephant was found in
the Dhalua range of the same division on Saturday. On inspection, the
pachyderm's tusks were found to be intact, ruling out the possibility of
poachers being behind the death.

Neha Verma, divisional forest officer, Ramnagar, said, ""It is not a
poaching incident. The elephant died due to electrocution when it came in
contact with an 11KV power line pole. Action has been initiated against
employees of the state power corporation under Wildlife Protection Act 1972
because it is a result of their negligence. Also 4.5 hectares of forest has
been engulfed in fire caused by the short circuit, for which also we are
planning action.""

The carcass of the 10-year-old male elephant was found by a patrol in Daula
range of the forest division. The patrol immediately informed senior
officials who rushed to the spot. The decomposed carcass was sent for
post-mortem which was conducted on Sunday. Forest department officials told
TOI that the final report is yet to come but findings indicate signs of
electrocution.

Uttarakhand has recorded a 15% increase in the population of elephants. The
2015 census has put the population at 1,797 while according to the 2012
census the count was 1,559. The census of elephants is due in the hill
state late this year.

Corbett Tiger Reserve got nine elephants from Karnataka government for
patrolling and other activities within the park. Earlier, the national park
had 13 elephants for patrolling inaccessible areas but seven of them died,
following which it was decided to bring new pachyderms.

A half-decomposed body of an adult tigress was found in the Dachauri range

Conservation (DWC), the very institution which is supposedly the guardian
of these majestic animals.

“When will we ever learn,” is the lament of numerous environmentalists as
there were howls of protest not only from them but also the public over
this “senseless” killing.

The DWC over-reacted and used excessive force than was necessary, was the
consensus among them, as two parallel probes were launched by Wildlife and
Sustainable Development Minister Gamini Jayawickrama Perera and the DWC.

The video of the shooting of the cow-elephant in Kombaveittakulam,
Omanthai, Vavuniya is heart-rending. Two adult females and their babies had
fallen into an agricultural well. Perhaps, a baby fell in first and in
their efforts to save it the others fell in too. The two babies were
apparently taken out first by the DWC. The agony and the stress of the two
bigger elephants, left swimming round and round, attempting to get out of
this watery trap is obvious.

Then comes into view, in the eyes of the elephants, what would have been a
different threat – a huge orange backhoe, while in the background the
so-called rescue personnel including the DWC staff can be heard shouting at
the animals. A ‘circus’ seems to ensue thereafter.

In the last moments of her life, the desperation of the cow-elephant,
firstly struggling to get up the muddy and slippery slope of the well can
actually be felt even through the video. Her futile attempts to charge at
the orange monster blocking her escape route into the jungle and finally,
the sound of one shot, a cloud of smoke, a second shot and another cloud of
smoke and a third shot and a cloud of smoke and as if in slow motion, the
majestic elephant collapses and drops dead. Since it is believed that she
was a nursing mother, her killing also condemns her baby to death by
starvation.

Whether the other elephant was also injured, as a gun-shot seems to be in
that animal’s direction as well, remains a mystery.

DWC sources told the Sunday Times that the department was conducting an
inquiry and the report was expected early next. When asked for details with
regard to the incident, the source said that the well was about 12km off
the A9, in a rural area. The rescue operation was carried out at around
9.30 a.m. on Monday (April 17). The elephants had been spotted in the well
the previous day. There were two cow elephants and two babies, but the DWC
was not certain whether the babies were of those cow elephants.

“There was absolutely no need to shoot dead the elephant which was of
little threat to the DWC guard who was on the backhoe,” was the view of
experts who analyzed this particular incident and pegged it to a wider
issue.

“Elephants charging at vehicles happens not uncommonly and jeeps do get hit
in wildlife parks. Raiding elephants often attack tree huts in chenas and
elephants break down houses to get at stored grain. Killing an elephant is
not considered the appropriate response in any of these instances,” said
the Chairman of the Centre for Conservation and Research (CCR), Dr.
Prithiviraj Fernando, who has been conducting research on elephants for
nearly three decades.

Reiterating that many other measures could have been tried, before shooting
dead the elephant, he said that the most logical first reaction should have
been — when they saw the animal coming out — was to move the backhoe, which
was clearly blocking her pathway to freedom. There seems to have been no
thinking or planning before using fire-power to kill.

Even if the backhoe was not moved, the animal could have been diverted from
heading towards the backhoe by fire-crackers first and if those did not
work, then non-lethal bird-shot from a shot-gun. These are tiny lead
pellets which would hit the skin of the elephant and caused pain but not go
through and leave huge fatal injuries. The cartridges with large lead balls
used in this instance as a first resort were absolutely the wrong
ammunition. The DWC guard could have also shot at the body and not made a
direct hit at the head of the elephant, the Sunday Times understands.

While the ‘lighter’ measures such as fire-crackers and bird-shot are tried
out, another official could stand-by with a rifle to take down the animal
if human life is endangered. But killing the elephant should be the very
last resort, according to Dr. Fernando. “It should definitely not be the
first-line of defence.”

The Wildlife and Nature Protection Society (WNPS), meanwhile, in a
statement issued on Thursday night, titled ‘From protector to executioner’
strongly protested against the shooting.

As the oldest conservation organization of its kind, the founder of the
initial National Parks and prime facilitator in the setting up of the DWC,
the WNPS underscored that this act of needless destruction of a
nationally-protected species by those who should be protecting them
counters every principle of conservation on which these institutions were
established.

“The available video coverage of the incident clearly shows that at no time
was human life in danger during the incident and the need to shoot the
elephant dead, rather than just frighten it away as has been done before,
is called into question. The video also shows another elephant being shot
at and falling, though the DWC claims that only one died. The DWC is the
main statutory agency set up for the protection of all wildlife, including
elephants. If they have now taken to shooting the animals they are supposed
to protect, then an already endangered species is doomed to extinction,” it
said.

Strongly urging that the two inquiries into this elephant-killing be
carried out with a degree of transparency that leaves nothing open for
question, the WNPS states that as per the available video footage of the
incident, the ‘circus’ that surrounded this tragic killing, highlights
alarming lapses in procedure and gaps in the law. They include:

Astoundingly, the DWC does not have an official protocol or procedure to
deal with situations like this, the extrication of wild elephants from
unguarded irrigation pits/wells, despite it being an all too frequent
occurrence of late. Had they done so, the army of onlookers would have been
cleared and appropriate measures taken to channel the rescued animals away
from the rescuers.

If a human falls into an unguarded well or pit, the person or persons who
made the excavation are legally liable for any resulting injury and costs.
Yet, when an elephant falls into such a hole, the DWC is not only held
liable for its extraction, but has to bear the resulting costs. These
wells/channels are often paid for by aid agencies and they should ensure
that basic measures are taken not only to prevent elephants and other
animals from falling in, but also humans. Those who dig these holes and
leave them unguarded should be held liable to pay for the costs of anyone
or any animal falling in. Such legal measures, if enforced, would soon
result in proper safety measures being implemented for the wellbeing of all
– humans and animals.

“It is hoped that this tragedy will result in the DWC and the ministry
commencing discussions and consulting elephant and legal experts to
formulate a protocol to deal with such situations where the destruction of
the animal will be the last resort, rather than the first, trigger-happy
choice. It is too late for this unfortunate victim but the world will be
watching to see whether justice will prevail in her killing and whether
there is any hope for the conservation of the wild elephant under the
present political and administrative institutions responsible for their
protection and under the law,” the WNPS adds.

Another environmentalist also pointed out that the DWC guard, who shot dead
the elephant, has been transferred to a different area, which indicates
that the DWC has not acknowledged the fundamental reasoning that the
killing was not acceptable. What the right course of action would have been
is to send the official on compulsory leave, as the killing of an elephant
is against the law of the country, at least until the investigations were
concluded. The message from the current actions is that it is acceptable to
kill an elephant even though it is an illegal act under Sri Lankan law.

Taking up a press release issued by the Game-guard Union that the guard’s
action was justified because the elephant was “on a rampage and the killing
was carried out in self-defence”, another environmentalist was quick to
point out that the video clearly shows that the ‘rampage’ part was totally
untrue.

The implication of such a stance is very dangerous, he said, adding that it
promotes the thinking that elephants should be killed and that’s what
villagers will do, making the human-elephant conflict take on a different
dimension. “We will give villagers an excuse to take the law into their own
hands if an elephant damages a home or a tree-hut. The message being told
loud and clear, wrongly, is that when faced with an aggressive elephant you
should kill it.”

April 23, 2017

With a two-year-old tusker found dead on Saturday, the Mudumalai Tiger
Reserve (MTR) in the Nilgiris has seen seven elephants deaths since January
this year. However, MTR officials say the mortality rate is not alarming as
the reserve has over 700 elephants.

Forest watchers on routine patrolling had found the carcass of the tusker
at Kumbarakolly reserve forest in Theppakadu range on Saturday. According
to MTR field director Srinivas R Reddy, preliminary report of the
post-mortem revealed that there were worms inside the stomach of the
animal. ""We could not guess the cause of the death. Samples of the carcass
were collected for lab test. Once the report is received, we would come to
know the exact cause of death,"" he told TOI.

Asked whether it is not a cause of worry to learn that about seven
elephants had died since January, Reddy said, ""It is not an issue at all.
The acceptable mortality rate is around 5-10% of the elephant population.
We hadn't touched even 5% ever. MTR houses around 700 Asian elephants. The
reserve can safely lose 70 elephants a year. But at the same time, we
should also see to it that 70-75 new elephants are added to the population
every year"".

According to Reddy, more cases of animals deaths during the summer season
is natural, owing to depleted fodder and water sources.",1

A four-year-old male elephant was found dead in Sirumugai forest range
in Coimbatore on Monday. This is reportedly the seventh wild elephant
died in forests of Coimbatore this year.

Forest Department officials said that the elephant calf was found in
weak condition in the backwater area of Bhavani Sagar dam at
Pethikutti section of Koothamundi North beat of Sirumugai range.

“Forest staff found the elephant struggling to get up from the place.
Later it walked up to the waterhole and drank water. Senior veterinary
surgeon N.S. Manoharan was informed about the elephant. Unfortunately,
the calf walked barely 30 metres from the water body and died while
the medical team was to leave for the location,” said District Forest
Officer S. Ramasubramanian.

The dead calf was part of an elephant herd that was roaming the
location. The herd spent some time with the dead elephant and
returned.

Mr. Ramasubramanian said that the reason for the death could be
ascertained only after the post-mortem. The carcass will be autopsied
on Tuesday morning by Dr. Manoharan.

The carcass of a 40-45-year-old tusker with only one tusk was found at
Antarsanthe Range in Nagarhole Tiger Reserve on Monday morning. The
missing tusk in the adult elephant led to wildlife activists to allege
that the animal may have been poached after its death.

On Monday, veterinarian Dr Umashankar had conducted a postmortem.
However, with wildlife activists and experts differing, a second
postmortem was done by three veterinary doctors. After Tuesday’
post-mortem, Forest officials said the elephant had died a natural
death and had only one tusk.

Speaking to Express, Nagarhole Tiger Reserve director Manikantan said,
“The doctors opened the skull portion and examined the alveoli pocket
(from where the tusk emerges) which was found to have callus growth.
The animal has lost its tusk some time ago, but we don’t know when. It
had only one tusk intact measuring 1.7 meters.”

However, wildlife experts and activists are not happy with the
findings. They say, “There is an organised gang of ivory smugglers
operating in the 10 km radius and Antarsanthe range is contiguous with
Metikuppe and HD Kote. In the last one year, two tuskers were found
dead with all their tusks missing in the HD Kote territorial range and
till date, the criminals have not been found. The department is not
serious about this case and investigating the poaching gangs operating
in these regions.”

Former Forest officer and Wildlife First Trustee M K Chinnappa said,
“The department is trying to bury facts. By this time, they should
have filed an FIR. Poachers are operating freely and there have been
lot of irregularities in the Antarsanthe Range. The department refuses
to take any action. This is not the first such incident in Nagarhole.
Last time, when an elephant and a number of deer were killed due to
poisoning, we gave them the information, but the department slept on
it.”

Pradesh have raised the hackles of forest officials and wildlife activists.

On May 1, the mutilated carcass of a wild elephant was discovered at
Ahutoli village in the eastern state's Nagaon district. This is about 130
km from capital Guwahati. While the tusks being missing is a usual sight,
villagers were surprised to see the whole 7-foot bloodied trunk hacked off
and lying some distance away.

Local folklore in the Karbi Anglong Hills, where the incident occurred,
said the ""trunk is the tastiest part of the jumbo's body."" Some members of
the residing tribal communities here, including Karbi, Garo, Dimasa,
Adivasis, are known to indulge in this wild meat.

ELEPHANT BODIES FOUND SANS SNOUT

Several cases have also come to the fore where elephant bodies have been
found sans the snout, tail and even ""stripped of all flesh and reduced to
bones"". While revered as a religious and cultural icon in India, elephants
are hounded and killed for ivory and also when they wander into human
settlements, damaging crops and homes.

Senior wildlife officers refused to confirm that the May 1 Nagaon incident
points to ""meat consumption,"" but other experts expressed fears that the
""newly acquired taste"" could lead to a spurt in elephant poaching.

India only has about 30,000 tuskers left in its forests and reserves, and
the huge animal enjoys the highest Schedule 1 species status under the
Wildlife Protection Act (WPA), 1972 besides declared endangered by global
body, IUCN.

TASTE DEVELOPED FOR JUMBO MEAT

Rituraj Phukan of the Nagaon-based Green Guards Organisation told Mail
Today, ""While historically, jumbo flesh isn't eaten by tribes of Karbi
Hills, we were surprised by the May 1 incident and similar ones in the past
10 years.

Our local intelligence told us that when the tribals come down to the
plains for weekly bazaar sales and purchases they sell the jumbo meat by
various names and have developed a taste for it."" Mubina Akhtar, a former
member of the powerful Assam Wildlife Board, added, ""The Karbi Anglong
hills are a part of the Kaziranga Elephant Reserve.

It's also a conflicted area with secessionist groups and armed bandits
frequenting it. While we can't assure that elephants are being killed only
for meat as it could be unviable, it is very much possible that there is a
nexus between poachers who are looking for tusks worth crores and the
locals who can get cheap meat for a kill.""

JUMBO KILLED ONLY FOR ITS MEAT?

The trunk is apparently the tastiest part to eat, said Dr Zahan Ahmed,
veterinarian with the Wildlife Trust of India (WTI). ""During my five years
as a wildlife vet in Assam, I have encountered several cases of elephant
death with the trunk cut at the middle and the base,"" he said. Elephant
meat, however, is a well-known delicacy in some Southeast Asian countries
and African nations like Cameroon and Congo.

""I have heard of specific cases in Arunachal, where the jumbo has been
killed just for its meat,"" Rituraj added.

Assam has a population of 5,000-6,000 elephants, though 300 have been lost
in the last 10 years.

Jayanta Kumar Das, an Assam-based wildlife conservationist, said, ""The
saddest part of the story, from what I have heard from locals, is that the
jumbo in the Nagaon incident was old and sick. It had come out of the
jungle on April 30, probably seeking help. Instead, forest officers drove
it back to the jungles and on May 1 it was found killed.""

MORE ABOUT ELEPHANTS IN THE COUNTRY

The Indian elephant is native to India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Myanmar,
Thailand, Malay Peninsula, Laos, China, Cambodia, and Vietnam. It is
regionally extinct in Pakistan.

District forest officer of Nagaon Subhashish Das said, ""The fact of the
matter is that it was lying in a pond. We were arranging for a veterinarian
from Kaziranga and a tranquiliser, and we could not keep it in the public
till that time. Unfortunately, it was found dead in those circumstances.
The postmortem report has found arrow heads lodged in its body. However, we
have no proof until now that it was killed for meat.""

location where the animal was found dead is a water spread area of the
Amaravathi reservoir, in the Kombu East Beat of Amaravathi section of the
forest range.

The carcass of the elephant was found at a distance of about 200 metre from
the Punganodai Bridge at the Udumalaipettai to Munnar Highway.

“As the mammary glands have gum-like secretions, it appears, prima facie,
that the animal is pregnant. The animal might have consumed high quantum of
prosopis pods in the available in the locality which would have lead the
fatal toxins to the foetus. However, the exact cause of the death will be

forest department, the drought has caused a shortage of feed to the
elephants in the Udumalaipettai and Amaravathi forest regions in the
district. Prosopis feed are among the limited options available for the
elephants for food.

According to U Sai Nyi Nyi, who is the officer in charge from the 9th Mile
village frontier camp of Thabeikkyin township wildlife conservation, one
wild elephant was killed on May 3 and the other on May 6.

Speaking to The Myanmar Times on Sunday, U Sai Nyi Nyi said the two
elephants had been shot by firearms.

A third elephant, he said, was hit by a poisoned arrow on May 10 and is
being treated for its injuries.

“We have seen wild elephants being killed in the Shwe U Daung wildlife
sanctuary and nearby forest areas. Two wild elephants had been found dead
but one that was shot by a poisoned arrow is alive and its injuries are
healing after receiving treatment.

“Now, we have to monitor this elephant’s health condition by sending people
into the forest to observe. It is not clear why elephants are being killed.

“One possible reason is because ivory is an expensive item on the black
market elephants are being killed,” said U Sai Nyi Nyi.

He said that on May 3, they spotted a dead elephant seven miles away from
east of Ohn Paing village near Shwe U Daung wildlife sanctuary.

Another wild elephant was found dead on May 6 in Sat Pae Nago village tract.

The elephant that was shot by a poisoned arrow was found near the 7th Mile
village of Thabeikkyin township.

U Sai Nyi Nyi added that one of the two dead elephants was female and it
was difficult to identify the gender of the other one as it was cut into
pieces.

“The elephant was in a bad state of decay when we found it. It was
difficult to distinguish the carcass as it was cut up.

“The head was missing and we cannot say if it had any tusks. The elephant
that we are treating now is about 25 years old,” he said.

He said that there are 20 elephant in the forests of Thabeikkyin village.

An account has to be made of the number of elephants in the forest by
employing trained workers and specialised techniques in order to get an
accurate picture, he said.

The forestry department, police force and respective general administrators
are cooperating in trying to nab the elephant poachers.

The workers at an adjacent coffee estate noticed the elephant on the
ground. Initially, they thought it was stuck in the mud. They later
realised it was ill and had no strength to get up.

Assistant Conservator of Forests Ramesh Babu and other officials reached
the spot with veterinarians after being alerted by villagers. “After
reaching the spot, we understood that the elephant had fallen sick after
not having food for the last couple of days. There was no need to
tranquillise it as it could not even stand up. Our doctors treated the
animal and it has shown signs of improvement,” Mr. Babu said.

The elephant was found next to the estate belonging to retired IAS officer
I.M. Vittalmurthy. The doctors suspect that the animal may have contracted
an infection and as a result, not taken any food. “We have given it some
fluids and calcium. Blood samples have been taken for examination,” said
Muralidhar, a veterinarian. He along with Badami, another vet, treated the
elephant. According to the doctors, the elephant did not move at all early
on, but gradually showed signs of recovery after treatment.

Herd nearby

Even as the treatment was being administered, other elephants kept moving
nearby. However, none of them came close to the area as many people had
gathered there. “We could see other elephants moving nearby. The elephant
had given birth to a baby 2-3 months ago, and the baby must be in that
group. When people leave the spot, the elephant group is likely to come
close to the ailing elephant and may try to take her along,” said Dr.
Muralidhar.

The Forest Department has posted personnel at the spot. The doctors will
continue treating the elephant after the blood samples are examined.

unconscious during the day, taking the number of elephant deaths in the
past eight months in the forest to 10. The deaths, however, were caused not
from poaching, but other reasons such as railway accidents, electrocution
and infighting.

Officials are considering extreme heat to be responsible for the death,
though they pointed out that a number of water holes were created to
provide water to wild animals. Although the post-mortem had been conducted
in the afternoon, the report was yet to come out.

According to wildlife warden Komal Singh, after the elephant went
unconscious in the Friday morning, his treatment was started, but by the
night his condition began deteriorating and he died.

""Primarily, it seems that the jumbo died due to extreme weather conditions.
However, the post-mortem report is yet to come,"" he said.

Rajaji director Sanatan Sonkar even pointed to a number of artificial water
holes filled with fresh water in the park area to quench wild animals'
thrust. Even a few trenches have been dug up for elephants to take mud bath
to cool off.

""All the 10 elephants died either their natural deaths or of some other
reasons such as railway accident, electrocution and infighting, but not due
to poaching,"" said Sonkar.

A male adult elephant estimated to be around 35 to 40 years was found dead
in compartment number ten in buffer area of tiger reserve. DFO buffer
Mahaling said the cause of death is uncertain so far. The elephant had no
external injury and was never found any wanting in health by the trackers
as well.

Sources said this is the second fatality of elephant in just a week’s time.
Buffer areas of tiger reserve Palamu have slowly become a death bed.
Sources said post mortem alone could explain the cause of death.

Birsa Zoo vet surgeon Ajay Kumar and Hira Lal vet surgeon of Latehar
district would try to find out the cause of death added DFO buffer. Sources
said the frequent fatality of elephants in PTR is a matter of deep concern.
It raises accusing fingers towards conflict between man and wild life too.
But sources said this is no crop damage time by elephant and hence
hostility of farmers towards elephants cannot be counted as a factor behind
this death.

Sources said farmers display anger on the spur of the moment when their
crop is damaged or destroyed by elephants but such a revengeful act in
times like this is a distant proposition.

Sources said the PTR officials should take note of food of these wild
elephants. Sources said on an average elephant eases itself 17 to 18 times
in twenty four hours period.

If there is any increase in defecation of elephant then it refers to some
ailments taking shape in elephants.

Sinaga said.

“They also destroyed an 8-hectare 3-year old palm plantation, which belongs
to my parents,” he said on Friday.

The elephants usually came at night, he said, adding that he and the other
residents tried to drive the elephants away using firecrackers. However,
the elephants remained circling the area as other residents also tried to
cast them away from the opposite direction.

He predicted that the three elephants are one family as they comprised of
two adults and one calf around five years old.

“We expect the Riau Natural Resource Conservation Agency [BKSDA] will soon
deploy a tamed elephant to lead the wild elephants away from the
plantations and residences,” he said.

Tamed elephants are usually used to mitigate conflict between wild
elephants and humans.

Nimrot said if authorities did not take swift action, he feared the local
people would not be able to contain their anger as their palm plantations
were eaten by the elephants. He said the elephants ate the palm shoots,
which will kill the trees.

Besides palms, the elephants also ate other crops including sweet potatoes,
beans and many other kinds of vegetables.

“If they keep causing restlessness among locals, I fear for their safety.
They are protected animals, but their lives could be at risk,” he said.

Meanwhile, Mandau district head Djoko Edy Imhar said he had contacted Riau
BKSDA to report the incident.

“BKSDA must lead the wild elephants away from local residences and
plantations to prevent any possible conflicts,” he said.

Agency official R. Hutajulu said his office had assigned a team to monitor
the wild elephant’s movements. It was detected that they were around the
Jambon public cemetery and the team would try to lead them to Talang Forest
at night.

>From this monitoring, it was known that the herds’ movements were slow as
one of the adult elephants could not walk properly. The elephant’s leg was
wounded from a trap, which struck it some time ago. The agency’s team had
treated the wound, but he said the healing process might take a while as
the wound was on the elephant’s foot.

Hutajulu urged people not to get panicky if the three wild elephants passed
their yards while they were herded to the Talang Forest.

“People must remain calm as Riau BKSDA is following their movements. It is
better for people to stay at a safe distance so the elephants do not feel
threatened and chase people instead,” he said.

The rampant conversion of forests into plantations has increased the rate
of human-elephant conflicts in the country. Data from the World Wildlife
Fund (WWF) Indonesia in 2015 showed that Indonesia had the highest number
of human-elephant conflicts in Asia.

The elephant is suffering from weakness, untreated prolonged abscesses on his hindquarters and elbows, and other painful foot conditions. Following the findings of the inspection reports and upon the request of the Maharashtra Forest Department, Wildlife SOS - a renowned non-governmental organisation engaged in the rehabilitation of rescued captive elephants in India - has confirmed that it is willing to accept Gajraj for long-term medical treatment and lifetime care at the Elephant Conservation and Care Centre in Mathura, subject to permission from the Chief Wildlife Warden of Uttar Pradesh. The reports, copies of which People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) India has obtained, also reveal that his housing conditions are inadequate. The uncovered chain used for tethering him poses a risk of injuries to his legs, and that the current custodian failed to maintain even basic health-care records, said a PETA India activist. He added that the custodian also failed to implant a microchip, which is mandatory per the Indian government's guidelines for elephant care. The reports conclude that the present management practices are grossly inadequate and Gajraj must be rehabilitated at a recognized elephant care centre. The inspection was ordered following complaints from PETA India. ",1

RUDRAPUR: A 13-year-old male elephant was found dead in the jungles of
Tanda range under central forest division in Udham Singh Nagar district on
Saturday. Forest officials said that the pachyderm is believed to have been
electrocuted by an electric wire in Pantnagar’s Sainik farms.

According to forest officials, a farmer had installed electric fencing
around his farm to keep off wild elephants. The male elephant came in
contact with that fence, following which it died. The farmer has been
arrested and will be produced before court.

“Forest department staff have already requested farmers not to connect live
wire to their fence, but some farmers are not paying heed. We registered a
case under Wildlife Protection Act against farmer Harbhajan Singh, a 
resident of Jainagar 5 and detained him,” forests conservator PF Dhakate
said, adding that the carcass seems to be two days old as it had started
rotting.

Forest department veterinary doctor conducted post-mortem. Later, the
carcass of the elephant was buried in the agricultural land. Experts said
that wild elephants have been moving out of the jungles with people
encroaching upon animal corridors, leading to clashes between elephants and
villagers.

The wild elephant captured from Attappady and currently caged at Kodanad
Elephant camp has a bullet lodged on its forehead, the Thrissur-based
Heritage Animal Task Force (HATF) has alleged.

With photographs as proof, the task force, in their complaint to the State
Police Chief and Director of Project Elephant, Ministry of Environment,
Forest and Climate Change, New Delhi, alleged that the elephant bore many
pellets too on its body after poachers shot at it with airguns.

“The Forest Department has not taken any step to remove the bullet or the
pellets from the elephant’s body. They have kept it in a narrow cage
without any veterinary care,” alleged V.K. Venkitachalam, Secretary of the
Task Force.

He recalled that in a similar incident a few years ago, when the Tamil Nadu
Forest Department captured an elephant it too had a dozen of bullets on its
body. However, they managed to remove the bullets and the elephant lived
for many years.

Mr. Venkitachalam noted that the elephant, caught from Attappady, was
attacked by poachers who are very active on the Tamil Nadu-Kerala border.
The wounds must have forced the animal to come out of the forest and take
refuge in human inhabited areas, he noted.

The task force urged the authorities to depute an expert team to Kodanad
elephant camp for removing bullet and pellets from the elephant’s body and
to provide treatment for it. It also demanded stringent action against the
poachers.

Meanwhile, R.K. Srivasthava, Director of the Project Elephant, MoEF, has
asked the State Chief Wildlife Warden to look in to the complaint of the
Heritage Animal Task Force and take appropriate action.

A wild elephant suspected to be injured has taken shelter in a local forest
grove near Balale in Virajpet taluk of Kodagu district.

Locals say the elephant seemed to be limping around in a 12-acre forest
area close to the Lakshmanatheertha river.

Ranjan Poovaiah, former ZP member, said the Forest Department was informed
and it has decided to track the elephant and tranquilize and treat it if
necessary.

The elephant apparently was with a herd when it first emerged in the
village nearly six months ago. Though the herd returned to the forests, one
of them — suspected to be a female — stayed back. “Ever since it was found
in the grove, the elephant has stayed close to the lake and is most of the
time in the water. When it comes out, it limps towards the vegetation for
foraging only to return to the water again,” said Mr. Poovaiah.

Previous case

Last year, another wild elephant, Sidda, which was injured was found close
to Bengaluru. Following a hue and cry by wildlife activists, it was decided
to treat it. Even the Indian Army extended a helping hand and the Madras
Engineer Group (MEG) constructed a metallic structure to help balance the
elephant but to no avail.

Odisha on Thursday. It was about 40 years of age.

An eyewitness in Jharjamda village, Sanjeeb Kumar Mahakud said he was woken
at about 2 am by the sound of a fence being torn down in his orchard. Two
elephants had entered the orchard and seemed to be headed for the Barjul
water body, half a kilometer from the village.

After drinking water, jumbos turned back towards the village when the
mishap took place.

Divisional forest officer (DFO) Sanjay Kumar Swain said a 11 KV line,
barely 8 ft from the ground, touched the head and back of the tusker. It
fell dead on the spot.

The burn marks on the animal’s trunk indicated that it tried to extricate
itself from the wire.

A herd of nine elephants from the Similipal Tiger Reserve were seen inside
the Krushnachandrapur forest for the last couple of months. The department
had kept a watch on their movements but could not prevent the electrocution.

Swain said the state’s power transmission company NESCO’s Baripada division
would be charged for negligence as it was aware that the place is an
elephant corridor.

A complaint against a junior engineer and ACO of the Baripada division of
NESCO will be lodged for violating legal provisions which stipulate that
live power wires should be at least 18.5 feet high.

The elephant’s carcass will be taken to a forest area for cremation after a
post mortem operation. Police and forest officials were guarding the spot
till reports last came in.

BARIPADA: An injured female elephant which was in pain for nearly five days
was provided treatment in Similipal Tiger Reserve (STR) on Thursday by a
team of veterinarians and experts from Odisha University of Agriculture and
Technology (OUAT), Bhubaneswar.

As per the direction of Principal Chief Conservator of Forest (PCC), the
veterinary department had injected antibiotic through tranquillising
process to provide some relief to the elephant. As the elephant is in
advanced stages of pregnancy, experts were called in to provide proper
treatment to the wound on upper portion of its  right leg.

Divisional Forest Officer (DFO) Sanjay Kumar Swain said, the department
learnt about the wounded elephant a few days back and staff had been
keeping a watch on its movement.The elephant is part of a nine-member herd,
including two tuskers, of STR which were seen moving inside Budhikhamari
and Ahari forest areas under Krushnachandrapur forest division for the last
couple of weeks.

A tusker from the herd died after coming in contact with a 11 KV wire at
Jharjamda village under Betnoti forest range on June 8. The live wire was
hanging barely at a height of eight feet from the ground. Another wild
tusker with six other female elephants of the herd were roaming inside the
forest, the DFO added. The female elephant could have sustained injuries
either from a branch of a tree or attacked by a tusker for refusing to
mate.

The injury was so severe that the wound turned septic and pus was oozing
from it, the DFO said.

The treating team included a professor and his assistant from OUAT, two
veterinary doctors from STR. More treatment would be needed but due to her
advanced pregnancy, other members of the herd are keeping a watch on her.

The 50-year-old female elephant, which was found weak on the banks of
Bhavani Sagar backwater area in Sirumugai range of Coimbatore on Tuesday,
returned to forest after the day-long treatment gi ven by Forest Department.

Forest veterinary surgeon N.S. Manoharan said that the elephant walked into
the wild around 10.30 p.m. on Tuesday. Soon it joined the herd that was
waiting for the senior member's return.

“The elephant, which had collapsed on the riverbed due to weak health
conditions, could stand on its feet around 9.30 p.m. It spent some time in
the riverbed eating fodder, and joined the herd in the forest an hour
later,” said Dr. Manoharan.

According to officials, the elephant was part of a six-member herd. As the
senior member collapsed on the riverbed, the remaining five elephants were
roaming in the area. It was also a tough task for the officials to treat
the elephant as the other members of the herd remained in the locality.

“The herd was kept at a bay using crackers. Apart from injecting glucose,
minerals were given to the animal to recover. We administered drugs to act
against parasites in its intestine as their presence was evident in the
dung,” said Dr. Manoharan.

death toll of elephants to six in the last one month.

Conservator of Forests Manoj Kumar, who confirmed the incident, told The
Hindu that as per the initial reports he received, the elephants which were
foraging for fodder came into contact with the low-hanging wires and died
on the spot. While two of the elephants were adults, two appeared to be
sub-adults.

The scourge of elephant deaths due to electrocution had been eliminated in
the last two years. With such incidents increasing, the forest department
officials now plan to take up the issue with the Chamundeshwari Electricity
Corporation Ltd. (CESC).

Kodagu district has a strong elephant population; but the extent of coffee
plantation is more than the forest cover. Hence, the authorities included
these plantations for the Synchronized Elephant Census conducted during May
this year to arrive at a baseline figure as estimates varied from 50
elephants to nearly 200 elephants.

Close on the heels of six elephants died in Kodagu district recently,
another incident of an elephant getting electrocuted came to light from
Bommnahalli in Gudlupet which comes under Kundakere forest range of
Bandipur National Park, today.

The forest officials, who conducted mahazar, said that the male elephant
which came in search of food came into contact with an electric fence
illegally installed in a private farm and died on the spot.

The forest sleuths have booked a case and are in search of landowner who is

Athamallik: A female elephant that was found lying at a farmland at Odasinga near Deulajhari tourist centre under Athamallik forest range after being afflicted with an ailment died while undergoing treatment Sunday. Forest officials buried the carcass after post-mortem in the presence of block veterinary officer Kailash Samant, veterinary surgeon Deepak Sadangi, assistant conservator of forest Rajendra Gochayat and forest ranger Prasanna Kumar Sahu. Earlier, locals had noticed the ailing pachyderm lying on the water-filled farmland and informed forest officials Saturday. A preliminary check-up indicated the 20-year-old jumbo was suffering from fever for a long time. It was assumed that the animal might have got separated from its herd due to its illness. Forest officials with the help of villagers first tried to drag the pachyderm to a dry place for its treatment, but in vain. Later, an earthmover was pressed into service to lift the pachyderm to a dry place. Then, veterinarians began its treatment but there was no improvement in the animal’s condition. Later, the pachyderm breathed its last Sunday morning, officials said. Jumbo calf found dead Bhanjanagar: Forest officials Sunday recovered the carcass of an elephant calf from a forest near Bardanda under Tarsingh range in Ghumusar forest division. The matter came to fore after some passersby complained of foul smell emanating from the forest. Later, they spotted the decomposed carcass and alerted forest officials. Divisional forest officer (DFO) Ramsami P and ranger Narayan Pradhan along with other officials reached the spot and recovered the carcass. The post-mortem will be conducted Monday, officials said. The reason behind the animal’s death was not ascertained yet, even as locals assumed it might have died due to starvation or after being electrocuted. An elephant and its calf were trapped inside an isolated well while they had strayed into a village in search of water May 25. Similarly, two more pachyderms were trapped in another well the same day. Forest officials rescued the mother elephant first while the calf was rescued later. This distracted the path of the pachyderms as the mother elephant strayed into the forest leaving behind its calf. Later, the calf was found wandering alone. Locals assumed that it might be the same calf. The DFO said the reason of the death will be ascertained after post-mortem. ",1

A wild elephant, popularly called Chillikomban, was found dead near a
plantation of the Chenduvarai estate factory under Kanan Devan Hills
Plantations Company Ltd. on Tuesday.

For the past two days, the elephant had been found in the area. On Sunday
night it damaged a tractor, van, and a bike near the factory. Estate
workers on Monday chased away the elephant using an earth mover and
allegedly threw stones at it. The elephant also uprooted some eucalyptus
trees near the factory.

The elephant was seen in residential areas on the buffer zone of the forest
for over a year. It got its name from its tusks that looked like tree
branches. The elephant often disappeared from the area to the core forests.

In September last year it was found with injuries, presumably sustained
from stones and bottles thrown by antisocial elements, near the Mattupetty
dam. The animal was found weak and turned violent due to the shortage of
fodder and water in the area.

On a complaint by animal rights activists, the Munnar Wildlife Warden took
into custody a tractor driver from the estate.

A post-mortem examination was conducted by a veterinary surgeon. A forest
official said an inquiry was ordered into the death of the elephant.

It is alleged that after it was chased away by a mob, the elephant returned
to the area via another route. It was chased away again using an earth
mover and a tractor.

With instances of wild elephants entering residential areas at Munnar,
Marayur, Mankulam, and Anayirankal dam on the rise, two kumki (trained)
elephants from the Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary have been stationed at
Marayur to chase them back into forests.

Friday evening.

A team of forest officials chased the elephant to keep them away from
Lamlibahal, but the herd entered the village and damaged a couple of
houses.

Later the elephant herd got divided and nine of them moved towards the
railway track.

Eight of them crossed the track, whereas a six-year-old female elephant got
hit by the Yesvantpur-Tata Express “Keeping the elephant movement in mind,

A four-year-old elephant, which had suffered severe injuries after biting
an explosives-packed device used to hunt wild animals for human consumption
is fighting for its life.

The illegal device commonly known as —‘hakka pattas’ — a mixture of
explosives with lead and ball bearings inserted into a piece of pumpkin had
been placed in a location in Hambantota. It is at that site where the
wounded animal had been found nearly two weeks after the incident.

The explosion had mutilated its jaw bones, teeth, and ripped off a foot
long piece of trunk. The animal is being treated at the Elephant Transit
Home Udawalawe.

Veterinary surgeon, Dr Malaka Abeywardena told the Sunday Times that even
after three days of treatment, there had not been any improvement as of
Friday.

“Due to the damage to the jaw and teeth of the elephant calf it has to take
liquid food. It is malnourished and weak making anaesthetised surgery
impossible.’’

Dr Abeywardena said that that the calf would have roamed near Hambantota
harbour for over a week after being wounded. The animal’s mouth and the
side of its head was infested with maggots.

“Antibiotics are given twice a day, while saline, energy boosting medicine
and vitamins are given regularly,’’ he said.

Incidents of elephants being killed by using hakka patas, shooting them or
poisoning them are on the rise.

Within the last five years, from 2012 to 2016 around 1,171 elephants have
died out of which only 104 had died due to natural causes, according to the
Wildlife Department.

The survey on the elephant population done in 2011 revealed that the number
of elephants in the country around 5,800.

Statistics show that during last year alone 279 elephants were found dead
and only 35 of them had died due to natural causes.

Dr Tharaka Prasad, director of wildlife health at the Wildlife Department
as well as the chief veterinary surgeon, said more deaths take place
because of gunshot wounds.

He said that a tusker and another elephant suffering from gunshot injuries
are struggling for their lives in Kala Wewa, Anuradhapura and in Minneriya
respectively.

“Elephants which are shot can only be identified when the animal shows
signs of weakness or seen limping towards a pool of water. It’s too late
then as it is badly infected by that time,’’ he said.

Dr Prasad noted instances of elephants wounded by trap guns set up by
farmers and surviving for years after the wounds heal, but the corrosion of
the iron balls embedded in their flesh, kills them eventually.

He explained that some farmers kill elephants by using toxic pesticide in
vegetables. Electric fences can also kill elephants in minutes or within
days.

 “At least three elephants are found dead every week. If an animal that has
been poisoned, eaten hakka patas, or has suffered burn injuries from an
electrical source, is found alive, there is little chance to save it,’’ he
explained.

There are 15 wildlife veterinary surgeons, but their main task is to handle
any epidemic situation in wildlife parks and not individual cases.

Meanwhile, wildlife rangers, guards and officials from various parks spelt
out the difficulties that they face in elephant conservation.

There is not enough staff for monitoring, for raids, to investigate those
who set explosives, or those who leave poisoned food in the paddy fields
bordering forests.

There is also not water in Galagmuwa, Giribawa, Hambantota, and Meegalawa
because of the drought. Water is brought in by tanker trucks only into some
areas.

“The elephants which roam in search of water take down electric fencing and
enter villages. The villagers shot them,’’ one of them said.

The lack of staff means they have to call up the unarmed Civil Defence
Force to help. They are not trained to handle wildlife issues.

The rangers also claimed that some elephants are wounded by their own
officers because they use live ammunition, not rubber bullets.

Director general of the DWC, M G C Sooriyabandara, said that over 65% of
elephant deaths are caused by shooting.

Elephants who fall victim to hakka pattas could suffer for over three
months and starve to death.

Mr Sooriyabandara said that use of hakka pattas within or outside of
wildlife reserves is illegal, but detection is difficult.

“According to the Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance any person who kills
or harms any protected animal is liable to a jail term and or a fine of Rs
200,000 to Rs 500,000.

Mr Sooriyabandara admitted that the DWC is short staffed, but said
offenders can be arrested.

He denied that live ammunition is used and explained that rubber bullets
are provided to officers for emergencies.

“We never encourage officers to shoot animals. We never provide live
ammunition, but if individuals are using them we will investigate.’’

Minister of Sustainable Development and Wildlife, Gamini Jayawickrama
Perera, said he wants to find the companies making firecrackers that
provide people with gunpowder to produce hakka pattas.

If animals continued to suffer, new laws will have to be drafted to
restrict gunpowder issued to villagers, he said.

Mr Perera said that the department needs at least 1,000 officials. He had
informed the cabinet that 200 people are urgently needed.

Tiger reserve officials here are flabbergasted over the discovery of a
highly decomposed body of an elephant at Goindee protected forest in Garu
East of South Division of the PTR. The decomposed body of the elephant was
first discovered on Sunday.

Deputy director south division PTR Mahalinga said, “It is most shocking as
to how this elephant remained dead, decomposing but none of our forest
trackers could smell the odour of the decomposing elephant for nearly six
or seven days.” Thousands of maggots have invaded the eye sockets, ears,
mouth’s aperture, rectum and other parts of the body of this decomposed
elephant, he added.

Chief conservator of forest cum field director PTR M P Singh said such
negligent officials whosoever they may be will have to face music.

He said, “I have given enough hands in every range and it is the prime duty
of a ranger to deploy the work force. Here in this case it does not appear
anyone has done his job any at all.” Singh reiterated there will be heads
rolling down in this case.

Mahaling further said there is a forest camp barely two kilometers away
from the site where this decomposed elephant was found but strange enough
none of the trackers patrolling the forest area of Goindee which is a
protected forest could smell anything.

He said the forest trackers will have to explain this as it is nothing but
a sheer negligence of duty.

Further the elephant has so badly decomposed that it is difficult to find
out if the dead one is a male one or a female one.

A team of two vet surgeons conducted the autopsy of this dead one but
sources said this is not going to help in ascertaining the real cause of
death of this elephant.

Sources said just four weeks ago a one and a half month old elephant was
found dead in the north division. This elephant was found dead in a sitting
posture. This year alone the number of deaths of elephants is around six.
There was no word of any lone elephant limping or down with any wound on
its body here and this death has robbed the PTR officials of their sleep.

Sources said there is a water nullah at Hakatoowa where comes a couple of
elephants and forest trackers could have noticed there too if any elephant
was there looking ailing or wounded at all.

Mahaling said he got used the metal detector and there was no beeping sound
to suggest any metal inside the body thus he ruled out any shooting down of
this elephant by any size pr bore bullet or cartridge.

A famed tusker in the Udawalawe known as 'Hambegamuwe Ethaa' has died after
prolonged illness despite the best efforts of veterinarian to save its life.

The tusker was found while in severe distress on Thursday on the bund of
the Rathambala Wewa in the park's border with Hambegamuwa. The park's
veterinarians immediately began treatment on the elephant, but it passed
away last evening (4).

Veterinary physicians who treated the tusker said the animal had five
bullet wounds in its body as well as several deep cuts. The cuts had become
severely infected and were life threatening, they added.

The tusker was about 40 years of age at the time of death.

According to the census on the country’s elephant population conducted in
2011, there were only about 120 tuskers left in the wild.

KOTA KINABALU: A female pygmy elephant with multiple gunshot wounds was
found in a plantation close to the Malua Forest Reserve in Sabah’s east
coast Kinabatangan area.

The elephant succumbed to its injuries despite veterinarians from the
Wildlife Rescue Unit (WRU) trying all they could to save it.

Sabah Wildlife Department director Augustine Tuuga could not be reached
immediately although his rangers were investigating the incident after they
were alerted about three days ago.

Danau Girang Field Centre director Dr Benoit Goossens said it could not be
ascertained yet if the elephant was a victim of poachers.

“It was a female elephant, it does not have a tusk. No meat was taken. It
is difficult to say what is the motive. It is sad and senseless,” he said
when contacted.

It is believed that the elephant could have been shot within the Malua
Forest Reserve area. It then fled towards the plantation where workers
spotted it struggling for its life.

MUNNAR: An elephant was found dead in the estate owned by ADGP Tomin
Thachankary’s brother in Chinnakanal in Idukki district. The dead elephant
was identified as an 11-year old cow.

Officials from the forest department arrived and examined the premises.
This is the third elephant to die in the forests of Munnar within the past
one month.

The elephant was found dead near the gates of the estate, which has
solar-electric fence going around it. The preliminary report says that the
elephant got electrocuted by this fence. The forest department has ordered
a thorough investigation of the incident.

The electric fence will carry current between stipulated intervals of time
to prevent electrocution. Nevertheless, direct current is passed through
the fence when the solar current is not available, which is against the law.

The ‘rogue’ elephant that had killed 15 people -- 11 in Jharkhand and 4 in
Bihar -- was shot dead on Friday, said principal chief conservator of
forest (Wildlife) LR Singh.

A day before the World Elephant Day, hunter Nawab Safath Ali Khan, who had
been called from Hyderabad, fired two bullets on the head the animal from a
distance of just 10 meters. The elephant died with minutes.

Forest officials said Khan and veterinarian Dr Ajay Kumar had tracked the
elephant near Banjali village in Jharkhand’s Sahebganj district.

Dr Kumar had tried to tranquillize the elephant from a distance of 30
meters. But, the pachyderm suddenly ran to charge them. The officials said
before the elephant could reach them, Khan shot two bullets on its head,
and it fell on the ground.

The wildlife wing of the Jharkhand forest department had on Thursday
evening issued a shoot-at-sight order after finding no alternative to
protect the elephant.

Principal chief conservator of forest (wildlife) LR Singh said a 12-member
elephant-chasing squad from West Bengal and teams of experts, villagers and
foresters had been deployed to trace and kill the elephant.

“The teams were finding it difficult to locate the elephant as visibility
was negligible in the forest due to thick vegetation and the hilly terrain
was not easily negotiable by vehicles. So, chances of capturing it was very
meagre in such a situation,” Singh said.

DS Srivastava, a state wildlife board member, raised objection to the
killing of the elephant. “Tuskers are protected under schedule-1 of
wildlife protection Act. It is irony that an elephant was killed in a state
where it is declared as state animal,” he said.

“The elephant was on the rampage for the last four months. But, state
forest department could not chalk out any concrete plan to control it. The
elephant could be protected by driving it to a small forest area and
digging trenches around it,” said Srivastava, a former steering committee
member of Project Elephant.

PCCF (wildlife), however, rejected Srivastava’s proposal. “Digging trenches
was not possible in hilly and rocky area. Also, it was a time-taking
process. Trenching could have been thought of if the elephant didn’t change
its location frequently,” Singh said.

The elephant was electrocuted in Dhalbhumgarh in East Singhbhum district
when its trunk touched a 11,000 volt wire, according to police.

The elephant was in pain for more than 45 minutes before dying.

In Jharkhand, more than 25 elephants have died due to electrocution in the
past few years.

In another incident, a herd of elephants damaged over six houses in Malhaan
Panchayat in Latehar district.

More than 700 people have been killed by elephants in Jharkhand after the
creation of the state in 2000.

A suspected elephant poacher was shot by a member of an anti-poaching unit
in Thabaung Township, Ayeyawady Region, on Sunday after he and two other
suspects were discovered in the vicinity of a skinned elephant carcass. The
wounded suspect was arrested before being taken to the Pathein General
Hospital. The other suspects escaped and remain on the run.

The anti-poaching unit included Forest Rangers, township police, and
members of the Thaephyu Sentry Police and Thaephyu People’s Militia,
according to the Ministry of Information.

During a routine patrol, the team discovered an elephant carcass that had
been stripped of its skin, tusks, and tail. Later that evening, they
encountered three men in the surrounding forest who were curing elephant
skin.

As the team approached, at least one of the suspected poachers aimed a gun
at the law enforcement officers. Lance Corporal Maw Maw, a Forest Ranger,
shot at the suspect, hitting 55-year-old Cho Tin on his right thigh.

Police Captain Myo Lwin, who led the anti-poaching unit, told Eleven:
“We’ve heard about elephant poachers in this area. After spotting a
slaughtered elephant, we continued looking for suspects and found them in
the middle of the forest. One suspect was aiming his gun at us, so we had
to shoot him. The wound was not critical.”

Two handmade firearms, four elephant tusks, chunks of elephant hide and
flesh, a box of gunpowder, a three-inch steel arrowhead, two 15-inch
knives, an elephant’s tail, and an NRC card belonging to a man named “Salai
Aung Nay Oo” were recovered from the scene.

Soe Tint, head of the Thabaung Township forestry department, said: “The
dead elephant we found was huge. So I assume the poachers are working in
large numbers.”

Cho Tin will face charges for illegal hunting and arms possession. The
anti-poaching unit is now on the hunt for the other two suspects, and
parallel anti-poaching operations are being carried out throughout
Ayeyawady Region.

In addition to being hunted for their ivory, Myanmar’s wild elephants have
been targeted for their skin, which is sold as a traditional medicine, most
infamously at the base of the Kyaiktiyio Pagoda in Mon State.

Elephant skin can sell for up to K5,000 (US$3.65) per square inch.

Myanmar’s wild elephant population is thought to have almost halved over
the past decade to between 2,000 and 3,000, though some estimates put the
number far lower.

At least 30 wild elephants have been killed in Myanmar this year alone.

In a press release issued in commemoration of World Elephant Day on August
12, Fauna and Flora International field coordinator Nay Myo Shwe said:
“Poachers kill female and baby elephants for their skin. Myanmar’s
elephants face extinction if it continues.”

Jamshedpur:  An adult male elephant was electrocuted in the forests of
Chakulia, 70km from here, in the small hours today apparently when he tried
to cross a mound of soil dumped for a canal job under the Subernarekha
Multipurpose Project.

Jamshedpur DFO Saba Alam Ahmed said the tragedy took place at Bera jungle
between 3am and 4am when a herd of 19 elephants was ambling along the
under-construction canal.

""The soil, dumped by a civil construction firm, was eight feet high. The
mound reduced the gap between the ground and a high-tension overhead
transmission line from 18 feet to 10 feet, which is why the tusker came in
contact with the wire. An 11KV jolt killed him then and there,"" Ahmed, who
inspected the spot, said.

The DFO said the canal work was part of the multi-crore Subernarekha
Multipurpose Project (SMP) and they would raise the issue with the
department concerned.

""We are conducting an investigation following which we will take up the
matter with the SMP authorities. It is definitely illegal to let
construction materials block pathways, particularly near an elephant
habitat,"" he added.

A forest department source said the post-mortem was conducted in the
presence of the DFO and other senior department officials.

""The herd has remained anchored at Bera jungle in Chakulia forest range for
the past month. Two villagers have died in man-animal conflict while over
20 thatched houses have been damaged,"" the source said, expressing fears
that the death of the tusker might further antagonise the herd.

Baripada: Though a host of measures are being taken to protect elephants,
the number of animals continues to decline in the famous Similipal
sanctuary and three forest divisions in Mayurbhanj for various reasons.

Despite the implementation of an elephant conservation project, several
animals have reportedly died.

Around 84 elephants have died in the last six years in the area, according
to reports. The elephant census is usually carried every two years and an
elephant count was conducted from May 9 to May 12, 2017. According to the
latest census, the number of elephants is put at 489 when compared with
figures of 509 in 2015.

Reports suggested that the number of elephants in Similipal has been
decreasing every year, but the department is allegedly not showing
alertness to protect the jumbos.

Unofficial sources said 84 elephants have lost their lives in Similipal in
the last six years.

The government took a good step to protect elephants in 2008 by
implementing the elephant conservation project. An area of 7043 square/km
covering Similipal, Hadagad sanctuary of Keonjhar and Kuladiha sanctuary in
Balasore was notified as part of the project. Despite this, the number of
elephants in the area has dwindled, causing alarm among observers.

Wildlife lovers and environmentalists pointed out that if the number of
elephants dwindles at this rate, Similipal would struggle to protect its
jumbo population.

The government had declared 2750 sq/km in Similipal as elephant sanctuary
in 1979. In 1986, the Central government earmarked 845 square/km here for a
national park. However, due to human habitations inside the sanctuary, it
has been deprived of the tag of a national park.

Elephant poaching has also been reported sometimes from the area. Another
factor for elephant causalities is electrocution. Due to human presence
inside the sanctuary, elephants are straying out of their habitats into
human settlements. Such cases have been increasing, leading to man-animal
conflict, observers pointed out.

The elephants have been causing loss of lives and properties in the
peripheral areas of the sanctuary.

Recently, a tusker died after coming in to contact with an electricity wire
at Jhadjamda of Badajod panchayat under Baripada forest division. Such
incidents have posed a question mark on the responsibility of the
officials. They are supposed to track and monitor the movement of elephants
inside forests.

Regional chief conservators of forests (RCCF) Harish Kumar Bist said the
elephant corridors have been identified. “As per the project guidelines,
the staff has been engaged. Saplings are being planted in forests. There
will be a rise and fall in elephant numbers during census,” he said.

UDHAGAMANDALAM: Two elephants died of electrocution in the Gudalur range
forests in the Nilgiris on Friday. According to district forest officer PK
Dilip, a herd of seven elephants were roaming in Kothadipudi area near
Devarshola in Gudalur range early Friday. ""While the elephants were trying
to grab leaves from an areca nut tree, the tree fell on a live-wire and it
snapped. One male elephant and a female elephant were electrocuted. It was
an unfortunate accident,"" he said.

While the male elephant was about 12 years old, the female was about 15-20
years old, the official said. Forest staff rushed to the spot after the
incident was reported by the public. ""We found a herd of five elephants.
Later, they were chased away into the forest,"" he added.

A post-mortem was conducted at the spot and samples were collected for lab
test. The carcasses were left in the forest area for natural decay.
Meanwhile, wildlife activists said trees close to electric posts on forest
boundaries should be identified and removed to avoid such accidents.

""In places like Nilgiris, soil is of very soft and earth is mostly wet.
Tall trees with thin trunk have shallow roots compared to indigenous trees
here,"" said an activist. ""If the forest department removes such trees
growing close to electric posts, it will be in the interest of both humans
and wild animals, especially elephants,"" he further said.

A forest department staff said the department was vigilant about
high-voltage live-wire fencing erected illegally close to forest boundaries.

IDUKKI: Man-animal conflict has entered a disturbing phase in and around
Munnar with the number of elephants entering human settlements registering
an increase. The safety of wild elephants are at risk with five of them
dying in 35 days in Munnar and Marayoor forest division areas.

While two elephants died of unknown causes, an excavator rammed the third
one, a brick wall fell on the fourth one and the fifth one was electrocuted.

It was on July 25 that the rogue tusker named Chillikkompan was injured by
an excavator on the premises of the Kannan Devan tea plantations at
Chenduvara and later succumbed to the injuries.

Postmortem report revealed that the elephant died of injuries in heart and
lungs. Another female elephant was found dead in Thalayar estate near
Munnar on August 5. The elephant had apparently slipped from a rock. On
August 11, another female elephant was found dead near the estate belonging

VELLORE: An adult male elephant was electrocuted when it came in contact
with an illegal electric fencing erected around a farmland in Erathangal
village on the periphery of Naickaneri reserve forest (RF) in on Saturday
morning.

The incident came to light when the villagers of Erathangal spotted the
lifeless body of the elephant. Damodaran, a villager, had taken the piece
of land on lease and erected electric fencing to protect the crops from
damage by animals such as wild boars. The connection to electrify the
fencing was drawn from the supply for the motor pump.

The elephant, aged seven to eight years, had moved to Pernambut range from
the Koundenya Wildlife Sanctuary in Andhra Pradesh. It was electrocuted
when it came in contact with the electric fencing around the field.

Following this, Dinkar Kumar, conservator of forests, vellore circle,
Sumesh Soman, district forest officer, Vellore and Krishnamoorthy, forest
range officer of Pernambut inspected the land and conducted an inquiry.

""The elephant comes under Schedule I of the Wildlife Act 1972. We have
filed a case under the provisions of the Act and are on the lookout for
Damodaran, who has fled after the incident,"" Mr. Soman said. A postmortem
was performed by veterinarian at the spot.

He added that Pernambut range shares border with Andhra Pradesh, and there
is frequent movement of elephants. ""In Vellore district, Pernambut range is
the only area where there is movement of elephants that comes from the
sanctuary. As crops are being damaged by wild animals frequently, we are
compensating farmers accordingly,"" he said.

Last year, the department disbursed compensation over Rs 9 lakh. Of this,
more than 50% has been given to the farmers in Pernambut range, he said and
added that around Rs 4 lakh disbursed to the farmers as compensation for
the crop damage this year. Of these, Rs 2 lakh has been given to the
farmers in Pernambut.

Coimbatore: A 45-year-old female elephant that had been roaming around a
farm in Jarathal near Erode along with its calf died of some illness on
Wednesday.

According to a source, one Ramu spotted the elephant lying unconscious and
its calf roaming around as he was passing by Pappathi Farm in Jarathal
around 6am and informed the villagers.

People soon gathered at the spot and alerted the forest department. The
villagers made an attempt to feed sugarcane and corn to the animals, but
the calf didn't let them approach its mother elephant.

Forest officials, along with veterinary doctor Asokan, reached the spot.
This time too, the calf didn't allow the veterinary doctor to approach the
adult elephant to offer treatment. Asokan subsequently tranquilised the
calf to provide medical help to the adult elephant. But, the elephant died.

The forest officials rescued the calf and took it to Sennampatti forest
range. ""We are providing treatment to the calf,"" they said.",1

IPOH: A tour bus heading to Gerik rammed into a bull elephant on the
East-West Highway near here early today, killing the 12-year-old animal.

The bus driver, Eng Koon Seng, 62, and the 32 passengers were unhurt in the
accident that happened at 5.30am at Km59 of the highway about five
kilometres from the Titiwangsa Rest and Service Area, said Gerik Police
deputy chief DSP Mohd Sohaimi Ishak.

He said the bus, heading from Jeli to Gerik, hit the elephant while
descending a gradient. The animal had emerged from the right side of the
road and ran across it, he added.

""The driver could not stop the vehicle in time to avoid hitting the
elephant. The animal collapsed and then got up and walked to the grass on
the road shoulder and died,"" he said in a statement here today.

He said the elephant was injured in the head and body while the bus had a
shattered windscreen and a huge dent at the front.

Mohd Sohaimi said the Department of Wildlife and National Parks had been
informed.

Perak Department of Wildlife and National Parks (Perhilitan) director Loo
Kean Seong said department officers went to the scene immediately after
they were alerted of the incident at about 5.30am.

Loo said the pachyderm's remains will be sent for a post-mortem to
establish cause of death.

He urged motorists to be cautious while driving along the highway as
several areas along the highway is the habitat of the elephants.

This is the second time an elephant has been killed on the Gerik-Jeli
highway this year.

On June 19, a teacher who panicked when she came across a herd of elephants
crashed into a calf at KM43.6 of the highway.

Gerik police chief Supt Ismail Che Isa said the incident occurred at about
2.30am when the teacher Aznida Alias, 49, was travelling from Tanah Merah,
Kelantan to Universiti Teknologi Mara (UiTM) in Arau, Perlis.

""It was pitch dark and the victim, who was driving a car did not expect to
see a herd of elephants in the middle of the road.

""As the elephants were so close to her car, she could not avoid hitting and
killing one of them. She then headed for the nearest police station to make
a report,"" he told Bernama.

He said the teacher, her husband and their three children who were in the
car, escaped unhurt.

JORHAT: A female adult elephant was electrocuted at the Katanibari division
of Sycotta Tea Estate under Mariani range of the Jorhat forest division
late last night after the animal came in contact with a high tension
electricity cable belonging to the Assam Power Distribution Company Limited
(APDCL) that passes through the garden.

The Forest Department has blamed the APDCL for the incident as the height
of the cable passing through the garden was considerably low, posing a
grave threat to humans and wildlife.

The forest authorities said the APDCL has reportedly not paid any heed to
the repeated requests made by the department concerned to raise the height
of the cable to avoid any fatal incidents. In a similar incident in
November 2013, two jumbos were electrocuted in another area of the garden.

Range officer (Mariani) Pradip Gogoi told The Assam Tribune today that the
elephant, which was part of the herd that often strays out of the nearby
Hoollongapar Gibbon Sanctuary, was killed after the animal’s head came in
contact with the cable, which was at a height of below eight feet.

He said the incident occurred at the Sasan Ghat area of the garden which
was near the Bhogdoi River.

Gogoi said his department has written to the APDCL several times,
requesting the latter to raise the height of the power cable, but to no
avail. He said the matter was discussed at a meeting convened last month by
the Titabar sub-divisional administration and the APDCL officials were
directed to increase the height of the power cable immediately.

The range officer said the APDCL officials and staff today visited the spot
and were sternly told to do the needful. He further said he has written a
letter to the APDCL authorities stating that the Forest Department will be
compelled to file FIR against the APDCL for negligence, if corrective steps
were not taken urgently.

Gogoi said post mortem of the carcass was conducted on the spot and the
dead jumbo was buried there as per the department’s rules.

The Mariani range under which the wildlife sanctuary falls is also one of
the worst man-elephant conflict zones in Assam. Elephant herds often stray
out of the sanctuary and destroy crops and vegetation in adjoining villages
and tea gardens, especially in winter.

According to the Forest Department records, over 770 people were killed by
wild jumbos in Assam in the last 10 years of which around 20 people were
killed in the Mariani range. Elephants have also died in the area by
electrocution or were killed by speeding trains.

A 40-year-old female elephant, ailing from injuries to its vulva and face,
was treated for its injuries by the forest department staff in the Sigur

Forest department officials said that the animal was found wandering in the

two days. Forest veterinarian E. Vijayaraghavan said that the animal had
injuries to its face, eyes and vaginal regions, and maggots had also
infested the injured animal.

Acting quickly, the forest department used darts to treat the animal with
painkillers and antibiotics. “The animal is standing on its legs, but is
refusing to take food. It is also cooperating with our efforts to treat it,
so we have also given energy shots,” said Mr. Vijayaraghavan.

DEHRADUN: Khalil Rahman, a mahout in Rajaji Tiger Reserve (RTR), had left
with his family for Eid at Kotdwar for just a day. On Saturday, he was back
at the reserve, grieving. His elephant, Raja, practically family for him,
was no more, killed in a brutal attack by a wild tusker that broke into the
elephant enclosure on Friday night.

Raja became the darling of forest staff at the reserve after being found as
a little calf wandering near the railway tracks that pass through RTR in
1992. His mother and two males were found dead nearby, hit by a passing
train. “Since then he was brought up with great affection here and named
after the reserve. The 27-year-old was with his mahout Rahman since 2001,”
said RTR director Sanatan Sonkar.

On Friday night, a 45-year-old tusker in musth broke into the enclosure
looking for a mate. Finding Raja, the wild elephant considered the younger
tame one a threat and attacked him. Raja, who was in chains, could not
defend himself properly and was severely injured.

“In the early hours of the morning, Raja showed some signs of recovery and
strolled around a bit, before collapsing. He waved goodbye to his female
friend, Radha, by touching her forehead with his trunk before he died,”
said Sonkar. The post mortem report revealed that Raja’s lungs had been
punctured, causing death, the director added.

“Raja was like my own child. He would walk to my house just a few metres
from the enclosure whenever I called out to him. My children would play
with him and he would reciprocate with gestures. He would eat whatever my
family gave him between his regular meals. He was never moody, always
gentle. He would listen to the commands in every situation. I can only
regret that I was not there when he needed me the most,” said Rahman, in
tears.

Besides the mahout, Rajaji officials and staff too offered garlands and an
emotional farewell to the elephant.

However, Rajiv Mehta, former honourary wildlife warden of RTR raised some
uncomfortable questions. “The elephant compound is properly guarded, with
several families of mahouts and staff living nearby. It is surprising that
they did not come to Raja’s rescue. Besides an outer wall, a wide trench
had also been dug outside it. This had filled up with slush and vegetation
in the monsoon and not been cleared. This made it easy for the wild
elephant to break in,” he said.

Sonkar defended his staff, saying they could not hear the commotion due to
the heavy rain on Friday night. “When they did, they managed to push the
tusker out, but by then Raja had been severely injured. No method has
worked as an effective deterrent to wild elephants,” he added.

BENGALURU: A young tusker was electrocuted on the fringes of Tanigebailu
Wildlife Range in Chikkamagaluru district on Monday, taking the number of
jumbo deaths by electrocution in Karnataka to 10 in the last three months.

During monsoons, sagging power cables, snapped power lines and illegal
electric fencing have been killing the gentle giants almost every month in
the last decade.

At least 100 pachyderms have died this way. On Monday, illegal electric
fencing became the cause of death of a 25-30-year-old tusker. The animal
was electrocuted near a farm at Nandibattlu Tandya village.

Siddanayak, a farmer, had electrified the fencing around his farm to
protect potato crops from elephants. The area falls under Tarikere local
range of Bhadravathi territorial division and is adjacent to Tanigebailu
wildlife range of Bhadra Wildlife Sanctuary. The young male elephant
suffered serious injuries in its trunk, sustaining a severe shock.

The farmer is absconding and a case has been registered by Lingadhalli
Police and Tarikere Range officials. According to G Veeresh, wildlife
activist, it was a single tusk elephant. He said, “This is the fourth such
incident in this region as elephants are electrocuted frequently. More than
three leopards were also snared in this area. Even people have died by
electrocution.”

Karnataka Chief Wildlife Warden C Jayaram told Express that seven deaths
which occurred in Kodagu district were because of snapped cables. “The
deaths occurred in coffee estates during heavy rains when visibility was
low.

These were accidental deaths caused by electrocution. After this incident,
we held discussions with ESCOMS so that all the sagging and snapped cables
are repaired. Now there is regular monitoring and inspection by both forest
and power officials,” he said.

In cases of deaths due to electric fencing, cases have been booked against
offenders, Jayaram added. “Compared to sagging power cables, deaths due to
illegal electric fencing have come down and they are rare now,” he
said.However, conservationists disagree and add that the forest department,
police and power companies should take strict action against offenders.

SHETTIHALLI: A 70-year-old elephant of Sakrebailu Camp died after a fight
with a wild tusker in Shettihalli reserve forest on Wednesday afternoon.

On Thursday morning, veterinary doctor Vinay and team did the post mortem
of the elephant. After its routine morning visit to the camp on Wednesday,
the elephant was taken inside the forest and its legs were tied to a tree.

A wild tusker attacked it around 1.30 pm and the tamed jumbo could not
react it as its legs were tied up. “The wild elephant’s tusks are sharper
when compared to the Camp elephant. So, the wild elephant’s tusks pierced

A tusker was found dead near Hosahalli in Sakleshpur taluk on Tuesday.

The reason for death is unknown.

Officers of Sakleshpur range reached the spot after they learnt about the
death of the elephant from locals. M.L. Manjunath, Deputy Conservator of
Forests, said the death seems to be of natural causes, but tests would be
conducted to ascertain this. Those who visited the spot said the carcass
had begun decaying, suggesting that the tusker died a few days ago.

The brutal killing pattern of the elephant by the poachers was revealed by
the head of the Nakhon Ratchasima-based Conservation Office 7 Mr Thakorn
Lomstaporn yesterday.

He said he was alerted by a foot patrol team of forestry rangers in Papung
wildlife sanctuary that it found a killed bull elephant while on a foot
patrol from Phukok forest in Nam Nao national park to Chulabhon dam.

The team said as it arrived at Huey Pong forest in Pa Pung wildlife
sanctuary, a dead bull elephant was found lying with its right side on the
ground.

A close examination of the decomposed body showed it was shot by unknown
calibre of gun on the left ear, and another shot 20 centimetres from the
first shot below the left ear.

The poachers chopped off it’s trunk and placed it three metres from the
body.

The front head of the elephant was cut off, indicating that the poachers
gouged out the skull of the elephant in order to remove the tusks which is
a brutal pattern of killing the dying elephant.

The elephant was believed to be killed a week ago and was in bad decomposed
condition, the team told him, he said.

The team also sought permission from local police to burn the carcass as it
was emitting disgusting smell, and it was far away from communities, he
said.

He said forestry rangers are checking closed circuit CCTV footages at the
entrance of the Nam Nao national park looking for clues of suspects during
the past one week and will begin combing the scene and adjacent areas for
other evidence to hunt down this group of poachers for court trial.

KAZIRANGA: An elephant calf, which suddenly fell down into a narrow drain
at Mikirjan in a tea garden at Behora near Kaziranga National Park and
rescued by its own mother, is now under the treatment of Centre for
Wildlife Rehabilitation and Conservation (CWRC) under Wildlife Trust of
India at Borjuri here. According to Dr Samsul Haque, attending
veterinarian, even though the elephant calf was initially rescued by the
mother elephant, but later in the evening it again fell down, only to be
rescued by local people.

By that time, the calf visibly became very weak and the CWRC was
accordingly informed about it.

The calf was then immediately brought to the CWRC and put under ICU
treatment, said Dr Haque. But now the calf is showing a sign of slight
improvement although it is not out of danger.

While talking about the problems being faced by elephant calves in tea
gardens because of the existence of drainage system at the very corridors
of wild animals, Dr Navin Pandey from Corbett Foundation felt that there is
a need for meaningful talks between the officials of tea gardens and Forest
Department to find out a solution to minimise the tragedy.

Dr Pandey added that often the calves suffered more in many of the cases
and, in some cases, the nature of the injuries remained fatal. He said that
already the elephant corridors in the nation remained very fragmented,
therefore the Government must initiate steps to keep the existing elephant
corridors intact even if these corridors were inside the tea estates.

MALAPPURAM: The decomposed carcass of a wild elephant has been found in
Thenpara area of Nadukani pass near Vazhikkadavu in the district.

The medical examination of the corpse has found a huge pile of plastic
waste which came out of the elephant’s intestine. Veterinary surgeon D.
Ramachandran said the consumption of a large amount of the plastic waste
could be the cause of jumbo’s death. The carcass was at least three months
old. The age of the animal seems to be around 26 years, he said.

The body was decomposed. According to forest officials, this was the first
wild elephant died after consuming plastic wastes.

The carcass found almost near to a place in Nadukani pass where tourists
and passengers used to take a break. They dump plastic wastes including
bottles of soft drinks and packets of food items here carelessly which has
become a threat to wild animals in the forest region.

The remains of the animal were buried inside the forest after the inquest
by the forest officials.

Electric fence installed by farmers to protect their farm crops from
elephants has proven to be one of the biggest threats against the animals,
having killed almost 10 of them in the past two years.

The death of a bull elephants in a para rubber plantation in Ban Khao
Khong, Tambon Pawa of Kaeng Hang Maew district of Chanthaburi on Sept 17
and the death of another elephant one day afterward in Kanchanaburi
province were attributable to electric shock from electric fence.

Farmers living in areas located near the habitats of the pachyderms used to
resort to firecrackers or install barb-wired fence to protect their crops
from hungry elephants looking for food, but with little success.

Hence, many of them turned to electric fence using electricity generated
from a 12-volt car battery as the deterrent which does not work effectively
because of the thick skin of the animals. Then, they turned to the 220-volt
household electricity by attaching the household electric wire to the fence
which has proven to be effective – and deadly too.

Since 2015, Thai PBS news team has discovered that nine elephants were
electrocuted by electric fence in villagers’ farms – mostly in areas
bordering with the habitats of the animals.

But during June-September this year, five were electrocuted. The most
infamous incident took place in 2015 in La-u forest of Huey Sat Yai
district of Prachuab Khiri Khan when three elephants were electrocuted and
found lying dead next to each other.

Mattana Srikrachang, a former elephant expert of the Department of National
Parks, Wildlife and Plants Conservation, admitted that she was shocked by
the news of the two recent elephant deaths – electrocuted by electric fence
in Chanthaburi and Prachuab Khiri Khan.

She noted that the deaths of the two elephants were a clear sign that the
conflict between humans and animals has become more violent.

“We found out that, in the 69 conservation areas which are the habitats of
elephants, there are 21 points where the elephants manage to venture out to
scour for food such as the forests in the eastern region in Chanathaburi
and Rayong.

Here, villagers have installed electric fence to protect their crops and
some of them used 220-volt household electricity which is against the law
and intended to kill the elephants,” she said.

Ms Mattana admitted that the government’s project to dig trenches to
prevent elephants from getting out of their habitats has proven to be a
complete failure.

She explained that since there was not enough food and water in the jungle,
the elephants ventured out and encroached on human settlements to scour for
food and water.

“The habit of Thai elephants has not changed.  They are not aggressive nor
fierce.  But elephants learn to adjust themselves.  They found there are
plenty of food outside their habitats, so they kept coming out,” said Ms
Mattana, adding that she would like to know how many people were punished
and what was the extent of the punishment for causing the deaths of the
elephants.

Meanwhile, Paitoon Intharabut, chief of Salak Phra wildlife sanctuary in
Kanchanaburi, told Thai PBS that his officials had already lodged a
complaint with Lat Ya police over the death of an elephant.

Minister of Natural Resources and Environment General Surasak Kanchanarat

with officials concerned to resolve the conflict between humans and
elephants and to follow up the project the trench project in Khao Sibha

A four-tonne elephant was fat  ally electrocuted at a corn field near the
Salakpra Wildlife Sanctuary in Kanchanaburi's Muang district on Monday
morning when it separated from its herd to hunt for food.

Sanctuary head Paitoon Intharabut went to the corn field in Tambon Chong
Sadao along with a veterinarian and police when the wild elephant’s death
was reported at 8.30am. They found the 25-year-old male bull lying with its
stomach on electrical wires.

Corn farmer Wutthichot Rojanaphokhapreeda, 48, told police that he
installed the 220-volt electrical wire fence around his 12-rai cornfield on
August 28 to protect the crop from cows and buffaloes but he failed to
report the wire installation to park officials.

He said that he only released 110 volts of electricity and a wild elephant
previously tried to eat his crop but got a shock and ran away.

Paitoon said officials would proceed with legal action against the farmer
as installing the electrical wire resulting in a wild elephant's death was
within the frame of illegal wildlife hunting.

A full grown male elephant, that had suffered injuries in a landmine blast
in naxal-affected Latehar district a couple of days ago, died, a forest
officer said today.

The 20-year-old elephant was injured when a landmine planted under the
ground went when the animal’s front right leg fell on top of it two days
ago near village Latu under Palamau Tiger Reserve buffer area.

The leg was severely damaged in the explosion and the elephant succumbed
last night, Palamau Tiger Reserve director M P Singh said.

The forest department tried its best to provide adequate treatment to the
injured pachyderm but in vain, he said.

ROURKELA: Elephant poaching appears to have resurfaced with recovery of the
carcass of a sub-adult tusker sans its trunk and tusks from the remote Sol
forest range of Bonai Forest Division (BFD) in Sundargarh district. The
Forest authorities, on the other hand, are not sure if any organised racket
is involved in the crime.

As per reports, the carcass of the tusker, aged about 20 years, was spotted
lying in Kunjar Reserve Forest (RF) of Sol range with its trunk chopped off
with an axe-like weapon a couple of days back. After autopsy, the
decomposed body was buried at the spot on Saturday evening in presence of
Rourkela-based Regional Conservator of Forest (RCCF) Lingaraj Otta.

The RCCF said it is baffling that the relatively young elephant was killed
for its tusks, which may not have been longer than only 8-9 inches. He also
said the trunk was hacked off and involvement of local villagers could not
be ruled out.

“There are two possibilities. Either the elephant was killed by poachers or
it might have died due to other reasons including lightning and greedy
villagers removed the tusks from the carcass,” Otta said and added that the
autopsy report is awaited to ascertain the exact reason of death.

Though metal detector was used, no objects such as bullet or arrow were
found, he said. The RCCF further said the Forest officials are collecting
confidential reports from villagers about suspicious movement of outsiders
while some persons were also being questioned.

Cases of poaching incidents from Gurundia block of BFD surface at regular
intervals. In July 2015, a sub-adult tusker, aged 25-30 years, was killed
with a poison-laced arrow at Dalai RF of Sol range. But poachers were not
able to remove the tusks due to timely intervention of Forest officials.

In February 2013, suspected poachers of North-East region shot dead an
adult elephant and sawed off its trunk for the tusks in Jharkhand, just a
few metres from Bisra range of Rourkela Forest Division. In January 2011, a
sub-adult elephant was found dead with its tusks missing in Sol range of
BFD and another tusker was killed by suspected poachers in 2010.During
2008, at least two matured tuskers were killed by poachers in Tamra range
of Gurundia block in BFD and subsequently, 18 locals were jailed for
several months after recovery of ivories from them.

KOTA KINABALU: Oil palm plantations are losing millions from damaged crops,
sometimes spanning 30 hectares in total, when elephant herds raid the area,
says the Sabah Wildlife Department.

Its director Augustine Tuuga told FMT that smallholders were hit the
hardest as they could sometimes lose up to six hectares of crops in just
one night.

“Elephant raids are a major problem for plantations in areas where
elephants are found.

“These herds damage oil palm trees and eat the shoots, causing the
companies to incur big losses,” he said, adding that Sabah Softwood Bhd for
example, reported a loss of RM3 million a few years back.

He said that the problem of elephant raids had become so dire that most of
the department’s ground staff were in Kg Gambaron in Telupid to deal with
the issue, bringing to a virtual standstill, investigations into the recent
case of suspected poaching in Kinabatangan.

The department estimated that there were only 2,000 Borneo pygmy elephants
left in Sabah and although the number was considered acceptable to many,
Tuuga said he was cautious about their survival rates if poaching continued
unabated.

He conceded that most of the elephant poachers were locals, who killed the
endangered animals mainly for their tusks.

“We found that these tusks were sold overseas but many also sold them to
the Timorese who have a custom of offering elephant tusks as dowries.”

On Thursday, the department released a statement that it was investigating
suspected poaching activities after an elephant carcass was found floating
in the Kinabatangan River near Sg Koyah on Monday.

The carcass was found by a tourist guide, who was with a group of four
foreign tourists on a river cruise in the area.

The elephant carcass was later brought to land where a post mortem was
conducted by the department’s veterinary officer.

In the statement, Tuuga said the elephant had been identified as a male,
estimated around 15-20 years old, and believed to have died or been killed
three days earlier.

Initial examinations found that both tusks were missing with evidence of a
clean cut at the area. The elephant’s left hind limb was also missing with
signs of a clean cut with a sharp object. Part of the skin of the left side
of the body had also been removed with a sharp object.

“The post mortem did not find any evidence of a gunshot wound on the body.
Although no evidence has been gathered so far, and in the absence of a
gunshot wound on the body, it is likely that the animal was caught in a
snare trap that eventually caused it to die of exhaustion,” he said.

The department is focusing its investigation on determining the most likely
location in which the elephant died or had been killed upstream of the
Kinabatangan River in which the carcass was thrown into.

This latest killing is the sixth reported pygmy elephant death in Sabah
this year including the death of a sabre-tusked bull called Sabre in
January, just three months after it was collared by the Danau Girang Field
Centre (DGFC) and Wildlife Rescue Unit (WRU).

Apart from poachers, many suspect the elephants were killed by farm workers
or plantation owners incensed by the damage caused to their crops.

In a separate development, Tuuga said the department was still trying to
track down suspects in the turtle poaching case of Bum Bum Island.

He explained that despite evidence that the activity had been going on for
quite some time, the department only became aware of it from information
they obtained on Facebook.

“We do not have an office or boat in Semporna and we only investigated the
case because of the viral photo. We held our World Turtle Day celebration
in Bum Bum in May this year to create awareness among the community there
on the importance of conserving turtles.

“In a way, I think it was quite effective because otherwise, they would
have just kept quiet and not shared their concerns on social media,” he
said.

elephant died after falling into a trench on Thursday night. The trench was
dug up for railway work in Telidihi under Bagadihi forest range in
Jharsuguda.

After receiving information, forest department personnel reached the spot,
rescued the pachyderm’s body and sent it for postmortem.

Sources at the forest department said the baby elephant, which is believed
to be a five-month-old, might have fallen into the trench accidentally when

HASSAN: A male elephant calf, believed to be less than three years old was
found dead under mysterious circumstances in a farm near Doddabetta forest
of K Hosakote village of the district.

According to the forest department officers, the calf died on Tuesday night
near a farm. Forest department officers found the body of the calf when
they were monitoring the elephant herd movement in the village.

ACF Harish, range forest officer Hemant Kumar and other senior officers of

It can be recalled that two days ago, K Hosakote villagers observed a bandh
demanding an immediate solution to the wild elephant problem faced by the
villagers. Former minister H K Kumaraswamy had led a protest march in the
village. Now the death of a male elephant calf under mysterious condition

Gorudhoria village of Lezai-Kalakhowa area in Dibrugarh this morning.

Lezai-Kalakhowa is 22km from Dibrugarh. A team of forest personnel rushed
to the spot after some villagers informed them about the dead jumbo.

Forest ranger Sanjib Bordoloi told The Telegraph that the elephant, aged
around eight years, was found dead but the exact cause of death is yet to
be ascertained. He said no injury mark was found on the carcass during
preliminary examination.

""The elephant was part of a wild herd which strayed out of Dehing-Medela
reserve forest. The herd, consisting 70 to 80 wild elephants, had stepped
out of its habitat in search of food which is common during this season. It
may have died of some ailment. There were no signs of injury or
electrocution. The carcass has been buried after autopsy,"" Bordoloi said.

Although the ranger denied electrocution as the possible cause of death,
live electric wires were seen on ground level in the paddy field where the
carcass was found.

Electric wires are put up by farmers around their fields to prevent
elephants from destroying their crops. In the past 11 months, three
elephants have died in the area from suspected electrocution while one
jumbo died of poisoning.

Although the forest department has filed FIRs in all the instances, no
action has been taken against anyone so far. ""Last winter, three wild
jumbos died in the same area because of electrocution. They come in contact
with such wires at night and die. Forest minister Pramila Rani Brahma had
said the government will take steps to reduce man-elephant conflict but it
has been seen that the conflict is rising,'' nature enthusiast Nakul Khound
said.

In 2005, the US Fish and Wildlife Service sanctioned Rs 5.3 lakh under the
Asian Elephant Welfare Fund for construction of a three-strand
electric-powered fence along Dehing-Medela reserve forest to check elephant
depredation in the area but now elephants easily move into the village as
the fence broke down a few years ago.

Coimbatore: A 55-year-old female elephant, which was sick and fell in a
farmland near Perur, was treated by the Coimbatore forest department on
Saturday and sent back into the forest.

Forest officer M Senthil Kumar said he got information from local farmers
of Karadimadai beat located near Perur in Madhukkarai range that elephants
were spotted on patta land there.

""Since it was a private farmland, farmers were worried. An elephant about
55 years old was extremely weak and was lying down on the land. One calf
and another female elephant were standing over it,"" Senthil Kumar said.

Meanwhile, the forest officials informed the local veterinarians,
anti-poaching watchers and anti-depradation teams who went to the spot
immediately.

""We wanted to isolate the sick elephant to treat it. So we used crackers to
drive the other two elephants back to the forest. Then we treated the
elephant and injected intravenous fluids into its body. It responded well.
After it became better in the evening, we used 'Kumki' Pari and two earth
movers to lift it,"" Senthil Kumar said.

In the first attempt, the elephant lay down again. After sometime, the
elephant got up and walked into the forest.

""It was successful operation and we are very happy. Local veterinarians
supported us and we are glad that we have saved the elephant. The elephant
did not have any major disease and it was not pregnant too. It was just
weak due to old age,"" he added.

Two rare Sumatran elephants have died of suspected electrocution after they
came in contact with an electric fence in Indonesia's Aceh province, local
media are reporting.

The elephants were found dead by locals in the East Aceh district on Sunday
with their tusks still intact, the head of the nature conservancy agency in
Aceh, Sapto Aji Prabowo, told the Antara news agency.

Local residents have installed electric fences around their fields to ward
off invasions by wild animals.

Fewer than 3,000 Sumatran elephants are left in the wild, according to
conservation group the World Wildlife Fund. The group identifies the
animals as ""critically endangered.""

The loss of their habitat to logging and industrial activities forces them
to raid crops in search of food, leading to conflict with communities, WWF
said.

Tura (Meghalaya): Two elephants were found dead near Jelajuripara village
in South West Garo Hills district today early morning, police said.

The elephants were reportedly moving towards Bangladesh from India when
they died, the police said.

The animals were found dead near the Indo-Bangla border and the exact cause

BARIPADA: THE death of an adult female elephant near Phulbadia village,
bordering Similipal National Park, sparked controversy as an activist
raised allegation of poaching, even as the forest officials suspected a
remote possibility of anthrax.

“The female adult was around 20 years old. She used to come here in a herd
of three elephants since the past three days. She was often found roaming
within the boundary of Similipal forest and in the surrounding paddy
fields. She might have died 48 hours back due to anthrax or natural cause,”
said Assistant Conservator, Arun Kumar Patra.

The carcass was found at a spot that comes under Udala range of Baripada
territorial division in Mayurbhanj district on Monday.

On receiving information about the elephant’s death, Deputy Director
Jagyandatta Pati, DFO Swayam Mallik, Assistant Conservator Arun Kumar Patra
and other officials rushed to the spot, along with a team of veterinary
doctors, including Dr Piyush Soren of Similipal Tiger Reserve, Khanim
Tangmaiee of Wildlife Trust of India and Sarat Kumar Patra and Debasis
Mohapatra of Udala.

The incident has set alarm bells ringing among the forest officials as they
fear the occurrence of an anthrax outbreak that killed around eight
elephants, a couple of years back.

However, the forest officials were divided in their opinions regarding the
cause of death. “The elephant died as she fell by the side of a trench and
received severe injury. The carcass had injury spots with the stomach
coming out,” DFO Swayam Mallik said.

Environmentalist, Vanoomitra Acharya, who also rushed to the spot, alleged
that the elephant was struck by arrows as her carcass bore several injury
marks.

“Poachers had tried to kill the wild tuskers in the herd and mistakenly,
the female adult fell prey to their arrows,” Vanoomitra claimed.“The blood
samples have been collected from the carcass.

It will be sent to Orissa University of Agriculture and Technology and
Animal Disease Research Institute, Cuttack to ascertain the exact cause of
death. The carcass was burnt near the spot. We are suspecting it to be a
case of anthrax,” Dr Piyush Soren said.

Chompoo, the wounded elephant who was swept into a canal in rural Thailand
and had us all on the edge of our seats during the two-day rescue effort
last week, died at the world-famous elephant hospital on Saturday night,
following the dramatic rescue.

The Thai Elephant Conservation Center, in Lampang province, held a buddhist
funeral for Chompoo yesterday morning, amid the sadness of the
veterinarians and staff members who had been caring for the pachyderm.

The wild male elephant, estimated to be 15-20 years old, was found stuck in
Phitsanulok’s Chompoo canal on Oct. 17. Since his hind legs did not work,
it took over 24 hours for officials to safely help him onto the shore.

Hopes were raised after a team of veterinarians were able to transport him
to the elephant hospital on Friday and named him “Chompoo” after the canal
he was found in. But after a good fight, Chompoo died on Saturday morning.

It was assumed that Chompoo died of kidney failure, likely brought on by
extreme stress, according to the Nikorn Thongthip, from the veterinary
science faculty of Chiang Mai University, Bangkok Post reported.

“The veterinarian team has done their best to save this wild elephant,” he
said in a media briefing.

An autopsy to determine his cause of death will be conducted at by the
National Elephant Institute, and Kasetsart and Chiang Mai Universities. The
results are expected in two weeks.

Chompoo will be a case study for the future treatment and rehabilitation of
wild elephants.

Sivasagar: The carcass of an adult male wild elephant, with its tusks,
trunk and tail chopped off and chunks of meat hacked off from the body, was
found at Dolopa village, 37km from Assam's Sivasagar town, on Saturday.

Residents who found the carcass in the wee hours said the elephant could
have been poisoned as it appeared to be healthy. They said the tusks, trunk
and tail were missing and chunks of meat had been carved out of the body
with a sharp weapon.

They, however, refused to speculate whether the animal was killed for
alleged meat consumption though they admitted that some locals do consume
elephant meat.

They said the elephant had strayed from its herd and was seen wandering in
the area on Friday.

Forest officials rushed to the spot and collected samples from the carcass
for investigation. They later buried the carcass in the adjoining field.

Divisional forest officer of Sivasagar forest division Bidya Bordoloi said
they conducted post-mortem at the site but did not find any trace of
poison. They have sent samples to the forensic lab and are expecting the
report next week.

Bordoloi said the death was ""mysterious"", ruling out electrocution as well.
Asked the reason for the animal's death, he said nothing could be said till
they receive the forensic report.

Residents said elephants, revered as a religious and cultural icon in
India, are regarded as enemies in the area as they regularly stomp into the
villages, damage paddy fields and demolish houses. ""Several incidents of
attack on villagers have been reported too,"" a villager said. Because of
the man-elephant conflict, locals at times take extreme measures such as
poisoning jumbos, he added.

The area is frequented by wild elephants and several incidents of
man-elephant conflict have been reported from there in the recent past.
Several elephant carcasses have been recovered without the trunk or tail.

Though, elephants are hounded and killed when they wander into human
settlements, damage crops and houses, they are also killed for ivory.

India has nearly 30,000 elephants in its forests and reserves and the
animal enjoys the highest Schedule 1 species status under the Wildlife
Protection Act 1972. It is also declared endangered by the International
Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).

Elephant meat is considered a delicacy in some Southeast Asian countries
like Thailand and Vietnam and in African nations like Cameroon and Congo.

The Indian elephant is native to India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Myanmar,
Thailand, Malay Peninsula, Laos, China, Cambodia and Vietnam.",1

Hassan: They were installed to keep elephants from straying into villages
and destroying crops, but the rail fences seem to be proving dangerous for
the jumbos.

An elephant appears to have injured itself while trying to cross the spiky
fence in the Nagarhole National Park. Farmers near the fringes of the park
noticed bloodstains on the rail fence and informed a wildlife volunteer in
the Ankammanahalla area of the Veeranahoshalli range.

Having checked the spot and spoken to tribals, the volunteer says the
injured elephant has been spotted limping and roaring in pain in the
forests.

""A few tribals tried to venture near it, but it  drove them away,"" he told
the Deccan Chronicle. On Tuesday the elephant was not able to stand on its
bleeding foot,  according to him.

The volunteer found to his concern that  the iron spikes on the fences were
rusted and what is more claims to have come across found similar iron
spikes on the concrete fence along  the Taraka reservoir on the fringes of
the Nagarhole National Park and along the Hosahalli boundary in the
Antrasante range.

While director of  the Nagarhole National Park, Manikandan says they are
trying to monitor the injured jumbo, a wildlife conservationist insists it
is time to do something about the situation.

""The injury caused to the Nagarhole jumbo should open the eyes of forest
officials to the threat posed by the rail fencing to animals and they
should remove it at least now, "" he adds.

Kozhikode: Wild tusker Maniyan, who had hit headlines for his unique
camaraderie with people on the fringes of the Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary
(WWS), has become a victim to the cruelty of snare traps.

However, the 35-year-old tusker was lucky to get timely treatment from
forest department authorities who tranquillized the animal on Friday and
removed the steel wire of the snare trap which was found lodged deep in its
left front leg.

WWS warden N T Sajan said the elephant has been limping around in the
forest fringes in acute pain for the past three days, following which the
department decided to treat it after chemical immobilization.

A medical team led by veterinary surgeon Dr Arun Zachariah tranquilized the
animal at Pokalamalam in Kurichiad range at 12.30pm and on examination, a
steel wire of the snare trap was found struck inside the wound.

“If left unattended, the wound could have become fatal. The steel wire
snare trap had sunk around 2.5cm inside the leg and the wound had developed
infection. The wire was removed and the wound was packed with medicines. We
hope that the animal will recover soon,”Zachariah said.

The treatment lasted for four hours. The animal recovered from sedation
around 4.30 pm and it was left free. The animal will be closely monitored
for the next few days. Sajan said that the elephant could have got trapped
in a snare laid to catch deer or boar.

The tusker had over the years became a pet to the residents at Kurichiad
and Chethalayan forest ranges. It has been so friendly to humans that some
villagers used to hand feed it. Maniyan on his part had been returning the
affection by abstaining from crop raiding.

Lahunipada: Forest officials Wednesday recovered the carcass of an elephant
from forest near Chhidakudar village under Banki forest range in Sundargarh
district.

The carcass bore injury marks on its back made by arrows with deep cuts on
its tusk.  Preliminary inquiries suggested the pachyderm might have been
killed by electrocution and shot by poison-laced arrows.

Its tail and hind nails were found trimmed with marks of blood noticed on
its mouth, ears and tusk. The matter came to the fore after locals noticed
the elephant lying dead and informed forest officials.

It was suspected that someone might have killed the elephant as a herd
strayed into the area and destroyed crops, K Bolang forester Harishchandra
Jena said.

However, the exact reason of the death could be ascertained after the
post-mortem report is available, Jena said.

On being informed, Banki ranger Salbinder Singh, ACF Dillip Kumar Sahu
reached the spot and took stock of the situation. The body was buried at
the spot after a veterinarian conducted a post-mortem.

Later, police officials reached the spot and joined the investigation but
failed to trace the killer. Notably, a few days back, forest officials and
police had seized two bundles of electric wires from the region.

CUTTACK: Decomposed carcass of a female elephant was recovered in Badamba
forest range under Athagarh forest division on Friday.

Forest officials said the highly decomposed body hints that the female
elephant had died almost nine to ten days ago. ""The elephant has died deep
inside the forest near the Dhenkanal border. Due to remoteness of the spot,
our forest personnel could locate it after so many days,"" said divisional
forest officer (Athagarh), Arun Swain.

Forest officials suspected that the elephant died of old age ailments.
""Preliminary findings suggest that the elephant was over 50 years old and
old age illness could be a cause of the pachyderm's death,"" added Swain.

A team of forest officials and veterinary doctors visited the spot and
examined the elephant. As the carcass was highly decomposed situation, the
forest officials buried it without conducting post-mortem. ""The decomposed
body can cause spreading infections and pose threat to other wild animals.
Hence we buried it. Our veterinary doctors are trying to ascertain the
exact cause of the death,"" said forest personnel.

Swain said that forest personnel are conducting thorough patrolling in the
forest near the spot. ""Poaching is not the reason behind the death.
Poachers hardly attack female elephants as they don't have tusks,"" said the
DFO.

Utai Bitdtakreu, 32, had been driving home from work on Sunday evening with
his wife in the car in Nakhon Ratchasima, Thailand.

But as he went round a small bend on a dark section of mountain road, a
wild elephant stepped out into the path of the vehicle. Utai tried to hit
the brakes as his daughter screamed with fright, but the pick-up truck
ploughed into the creature.

Incredibly, the elephant survived and the driver and his passenger crawled
out of the wreckage unhurt after the accident at 7.30pm in the Khao Yai
National Park.

Utai, a forestry worker, said: ‘We were a little bit shaken up by the
accident but our first thoughts were for the elephant. ‘There are a lot of
elephants that cross the road and I’m so sorry I did not see this one in
time. It just ran across the road. It might have thought that it could get
across in time.’

Rescue workers arrived and began looking for the elephant which they
believed might have been injured in the crash but they were unable to trace
it.

However, Utain returned early the next morning and recorded three elephants
crossing the road and he believes the one at the back of the line is the
beast he hit. It appeared to have an injured hind left leg.

He said: ‘It’s a big relief knowing that the elephant is alive and walking
around.’

National Park boss Kanchit Sareenpuanron said that workers had been sent to
find the elephant and give it treatment for its leg.

He said: ‘We received the call at 7.30pm and arrived at the scene quickly
to give help. Staff have been ordered to follow that elephant which has
been injured and administer treatment.’

The Khao Yai National Park covers some 1250 square miles across several
neighbouring provinces in central Thailand.

COIMBATORE: A large abscess from the left foreleg of a 25-year-old elephant
was removed today by forest department veterinarians at Anaikatti on the
city outskirts.

The pachyderm was found struggling to walk by villagers who then informed
forest department officials on Friday last.

The veterinarians, who rushed to the spot, rejuvenated the pachyderm by
feeding it sugarcane, salt and other fodder, after which they decided to
perform the surgery .

However, it hid in a thick bush, delaying treatment after which two kumkis
(tamed elephants) were brought in to control it during surgery and an earth
mover placed as standby, department sources said.

Officials managed to bring it out of the bush later and tranquilised it.
the surgery was then performed and the abscess removed, they said.

The pachyderm later moved towards a stream, the officials said, adding that
two teams have been formed to monitor its movement and condition.

KRISHNAGIRI: A 30-year-old pregnant elephant was found dead near
Denkanikottai on Tuesday.

The forest officials were unable to confirm the cause of the death. ""We
have been waiting for the autopsy report to ascertain the cause of
elephant's death,"" a forest official said.

On Monday evening, people of Dhasarapalli village found the carcass near a
ragi field and informed the forest officials about it. As it was dark, the
forest officials went to the spot on Tuesday morning.

At first, the officials thought that the jumbo might be electrocuted. ""But,
there was no live wires nearby,"" the official said.

A team of veterinarians from Krishnagiri reached the spot and conducted an
autopsy.

They found that the elephant was pregnant. After collecting samples of dung
as well as removing vital organs like liver and spleen, the carcass was
buried inside the reserve forest. The official said the jumbo might have
failed to take food for some time due to ailments.

GOALPARA: The Rongjuli range forest office in Assam's Goalpara district has
filed an FIR against Sofikur Rahman of Kheropara village in connection with
Wednesday's electrocution of an elephant in adjacent Satabari village, 50km
from here.

The 15-year-old female elephant was allegedly electrocuted in Rahman's
paddy field and a part of its trunk was taken away by goons.

The FIR was lodged on the basis of a statement by Ashwini Rabha, a resident
of Satabari, from whose house Rahman had taken the connection to his field.

Forest ranger Balen Das said, ""During our joint investigation with police,
we found that a live electric wire that was encircling a paddy field took
the life of the animal."" Quoting Rabha he said the electric connection was
taken to the paddy field by Sofikur.

Das said a 50- bigha wetland attached to the forest is illegally used for
cultivation by the locals. ""This encroachment blocks an elephant corridor
and the free movement of the animals, leading to man-animal conflict,"" he
said.

The investigation also shed light on other significant issues.

Gul Bahadur, accused of tree felling and timber smuggling, has been
appointed by police as a local village defence volunteer secretary.

He has been instrumental in encroachment of the forest areas cleared by the
department in February. ""From next year, we won't let anyone cultivate in
forest wetlands.

Even if they do, they will be bound by contract not to oppose elephants
grazing their paddy fields,"" DFO Acharya Goswami said.

KOTA KINABALU: Yet another Borneo Pygmy Elephant was found dead from bullet
wounds at an oil palm estate at a plantation near Kalabakan in Tawau.

The bull elephant, with its tusks intact, was likely shot by poachers said,
Sabah Wildlife Department Director Augustine Tuuga, Thursday.

""The tusk is still intact and post-mortem result found three bullets on the
carcass. The elephant could have been shot elsewhere and fled.

""We are trying to track down the culprit and are also looking for those who

The adult female elephant, however, succumbed to its injuries.

An elephant carcass was found in a plantation near Dumpas in Kalabakan and
weeks later another was found floating along the Kinabatangan river close
to the Danau Girang Field Research Centre.

Both carcasses were found without their tusks.

Five people have been killed in the last 48 hours by elephants and two
tuskers have died in one week in Jharkhand, officials said on Thursday,
pointing to the rising conflict between humans and animals in the state.

Forest department officials said 60-year-old Sambhu Lohra and 67-year-old
Maheshwar Mahato were trampled to death by a wild pachyderm in Bundu,
around 40 km from state capital Ranchi, on Wednesday.

The rogue elephant, they said, was separated from its herd a week ago and
has been attacking villagers since then.

Bundu forest ranger Ranvir Singh said Lohra was returning to his Shyam
Nagar village from weekly market, called haat in the local dialect, on his
bicycle when the elephant attacked him.

“The tusker, who left the Tetla forest around 4pm, accosted Sambhu at
Joikya Garha area. The old man could not escape and the elephant crushed
him to death,” Singh said.

He said the elephant, on his way to West Bengal, reached Birdih area after
a couple of hours where it came across Mahato, who was returning to his
farm. He tried to escape but the elephant chased and killed him.

The forest officials said that the families of the deceased would be given
a compensation of Rs 4 lakh each. “For immediate relief, a cheque of Rs
50,000 was handed over to the family,” Singh said.

Three deaths were reported on Tuesday in Hazaribagh and Gumla.

In Hazaribagh’s Churchu block a herd killed 60-year-old Maha Hansda as he
was minding his cattle in a nearby jungle. And two shepherds from Bihar
were trampled to death in a tuskers attack in Jharkhand’s Gumla district.

According to the forest department’s estimates, more than 300 people are
killed across the country every year by elephants.

Hundreds of elephants have died at the same from poaching, road and train
accidents, electrocution and poisoning amid unplanned development and
encroachments leading to loss of forests and their habitat.

Elephants are long range animals that require large habitats but newer
human habitations have cut off elephant corridors, trapping the giant
mammals in smaller areas and forcing them to raid towns and villages.

Two tuskers have died in less than a week and 13 so far this year in the
eastern state.

In the forested state of Jharkhand, the rising man-elephant conflict has
claimed the lives of 59 people every year in last one decade. The highest
casualty was recorded in 2011 when 69 people were killed by tuskers.

State wildlife board member DS Srivastava said that the forest department
has failed to check man-elephant conflicts in the state.

“Scarcity of selected food for elephants like bamboo, kajhi and khair in
Jharkhand forests have led jumbos to intrude villages for food causing
man-elephant conflict and crop damage,” he said.

India is the world’s stronghold for the Asian elephant and boasts over 70%
of the global population of the species. The environment ministry has
pegged India’s wild elephant population at 27,312 across 23 states after a
population count between March and May this year.",1

BENGALURU: A government veterinarian from Karnataka, who led efforts to
revive a female elephant which was suspected to have suffered a lumbar
injury after falling into a 18-ft-deep well in Chhattisgarh, is distraught
after the jumbo breathed its last on Friday evening.

Padmavati, weighing around three tonnes, had been pulled out of the well on
November 14 in a 42-hour operation involving a dozen trained elephants, two
cranes and a JCB. Though the Chhattisgarh forest department had two
veterinarians, the authorities decided to get in touch with Dr Prayag H S,
a senior wildlife veterinarian, who has worked with Mysore Zoo as well as
the Karnataka forest department.

Dr Prayag assists forest departments of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Telangana
in animal-rescue operations and is pursuing his PhD in wildlife from
Karnataka Veterinary, Animal and Fisheries Sciences University, Bidar. He
said on November 16 he got a call and a letter from the office of the chief
conservator of forests circle, Ambikapur (Chhattisgarh). He said he didn't
think twice before heading to Raipur, from where he went straight to the
Pingla Rehabilitation Centre where the elephant was kept.

""They needed expertise and right equipment to treat the sub-adult elephant.
I rushed there with an x-ray machine and drugs. They had sent me pictures
and videos of the rescue operation through WhatsApp before I reached the
spot. This helped me equip myself for the treatment,"" he added.

The operation, however, was fraught with challenges. ""On Thursday, there
was a Naxal attack near the camp. The principal chief conservator of
forests told us to get back to the inspection bungalow located 100km away.
On Friday morning, I returned to the camp,"" said Prayag.

Padmavati died around 3pm. ""There were worrying signs since morning. The
elephant wasn't flapping its ears nor moving its tail, clearly indicating
lumbar injury. An elephant generally drinks up to 150-170 litres of water,
but this one didn't even touch water despite our best efforts. The animal
was severely dehydrated and running high temperature. Soon, her pulse grew
weak and veins collapsed. Despite our best efforts, we could not revive
her,"" said Prayag. ""The cause of death will be known after postmortem,""
said a forest official from Chhattisgarh.

Wildlife conservationists have expressed concern regarding the deaths and
injuries to elephants caused by landmines allegedly laid by Myanmar
security forces along its border with Bangladesh.

A wild elephant died after stepping on a landmine along Naikhongchari
border area in Bandarban district on November 21.

Confirming the death, Divisional Forest Officer of Lama Forest Division Md
Kamal Uddin said: “The giant mammal sustained injuries Monday night after
stepping on a landmine in the no-man’s land along Naikhongchari border.
“The elephant died the next day.”

Expressing grave concern, eminent wildlife biologist Dr AHM Raihan Sarker
told the Dhaka Tribune: “Some 350 elephants live in Bangladesh while around
5,000 of the large mammals live in Myanmar.

“It is a matter of serious concern that the Myanmar forces erected barbed
wire fences and laid landmines along the border. Like any other mammal,
elephants too require undisturbed feeding, breeding and resting places.”

“The movement of elephants between the two countries will be disrupted due
to the landmines laid along the border,” he said, adding that the existence
of the mammals will be put at great risk.

Dr Raihan, who also teaches at the Institute of Forestry & Environmental
Sciences (IFES) at Chittagong University, said the home range of an
elephant usually covers 300 square kilometres and these mammals always
follow set routes and corridors for movement.

“If their usual routes are disrupted, the elephants will be forced to
venture into uncharted territory, which may also cause a behavioural
change. Therefore, the trans-boundary routes of elephants should be kept
uninterrupted, otherwise, it will take a huge toll on the genetic diversity
of the largest land mammals,” cautioned the wildlife biologist.

 He said: “In general, the higher the genetic variation or gene pool within
a breeding population, the less likely it is to suffer from inbreeding
depression. Inbreeding is the production of offspring from the mating or
breeding of individuals or organisms that are closely related genetically.

“Inbreeding results in homozygosity which can increase the chances of
offspring being affected by recessive or deleterious traits. This generally
leads to decreased biological fitness of a population, which is also called
inbreeding depression.”

Md Jahidul Kabir, conservator of forests (wildlife and nature conservation
circle), echoed the same sentiment.

He told the Dhaka Tribune that they were taking the landmine-related
casualties of elephants in all seriousness and had notified the authorities
concerned in this regard.

Jahidul said: “Any disruption to the mobility of the elephants will
certainly endanger the genetic diversity. Genetic diversity is of great
importance.

“The greater the genetic diversity within a species, the greater the
chances of long-term survival for the species. This is because negative
traits or inherited diseases become widespread within a population when
that population is left to reproduce only with its own members.”

According to a publication titled “Status of Asian Elephants in
Bangladesh”, elephants belong to two species – Asian elephant (Elephas
maximus) and African elephant (Loxodonta africana).

The IUCN Red List of Bangladesh categorized Asian elephant as “critically
endangered” as the species of wild animal is now at risk of extinction.

According to a survey conducted by the IUCN from 2013-2016, three types of
elephants – resident, migratory and captive – are found in Bangladesh. The
survey said there are 268 resident wild elephants, 93 migratory elephants
and 96 captive elephants in Bangladesh.

Almost a century ago, elephants were a very common sight in the forests of
Bangladesh and scientists reported the existence of 500 elephants in the
forest of Bangladesh back in 1950s. However, a recent study has put the
number of Asian elephants in Bangladesh in between 228-327.

When contacted, Chief Conservator of Forest Shafiuyl Alam Chowdhury said
they were concerned, but the Forest Department has very little to do in
this regard.

Earlier in September, Reuters published a story which stated that Myanmar
was laying landmines across a section of its border with Bangladesh to
prevent the return of Rohingyas fleeing the violence in the country.

In her September 21 address to the UN General Assembly in New York, Prime
Minister Sheikh Hasina accused Myanmar of laying landmines along the
border.

Later on September 23, Human Rights Watch (HRW) asked Myanmar to join the
1997 Mine Treaty and called upon the country’s government to immediately
stop using antipersonnel landmines along the border.

The rights group also said Myanmar’s Deputy Minister of Defence Major
General Myint Nwe had admitted its army continuing to use landmines in
armed conflicts in the country. However, Myanmar leaders say they use
landmines to safeguard the life and property of people and in self-defence.

Fortify Rights, a US-based rights group, revealed that nine out of the 14
states and regions in Myanmar are contaminated with landmines, making it
the world’s third most landmine-contaminated country, after Afghanistan and
Colombia.

In a report published on September 9, Amnesty International (AI) said the
Myanmar Army is one of few state forces in the world, along with North
Korea and Syria, to still openly use antipersonnel landmines. “Authorities
must immediately end this abhorrent practice against people who are already
fleeing persecution,” the report pointed out.

On September 12, International Campaign to Ban Landmines (ICBL) in a report
titled “Reports of landmine use in Myanmar” mentioned that the armed forces
of Myanmar have been using antipersonnel mines for decades.

The ICBL also called upon the Myanmar government, as well as all other
armed actors in the country, to renounce the use of antipersonnel mines
once and for all.

A carcass of an elephant was found inside the Kahalla, Pallekale reserve
and officials fear it is the carcass of ‘Galgamuwe Dala Puttuwa’. Officials
began to suspect that the ‘Galgamuwa Tusker’ was killed few days ago
(November 24) after the tusker disappeared for over two months.

Suspicions heightened when two suspects were arrested while in possession
of a pair of elephant tusks and ivory organic gemstones.

What caught the eye of officials were that the tusks, which were in
possession of the arrested suspects, had the identical, unique curvature of
the ones of ‘Galgamuwa Dala Puttuwa’.

It was later confirmed that the gemstones and tusks found in fact did
belong to the ‘Galgamuwa Tusker’.

Two wild elephants were electrocuted as they encountered live electric wire
in Lohagora upazila of Chittagong early Saturday.

Locals set up electric fences around their paddy field and the two
elephants—a mother and her calf – accidentally came in contact with wire.

A police complaint was lodged with Lohagora Police Station in this
connection this evening, our Chittagong staff correspondent reports.

Lohagara Police Station Officer-in-Charge Mohammed Shahjahan told The Daily
Star: “The line was set up to hunt wild pig. We were investigating the
matter. Legal action will be taken in this regard.”

AGRA: In a six-day rescue operation carried out by Wildlife SOS in
collaboration with UP forest department and police personnel, a 44-year-old
elephant was rescued from a group of wildlife traffickers.

The elephant had spent nearly four decades in illegal custody and was found
to be suffering from chronic medical problems like progressive blindness,
arthritis, degenerative joint disorder and foot issues — all pointing to
severe neglect, lack of medical care and improper diet, according Wildlife
SOS officials.

After several days of investigation, the chief wildlife warden, UP forest
department, shifted the pachyderm to Wildlife SOS Elephant Care and
Conservation Centre (ECCC) in Mathura where it will be under lifetime care
and treatment.

“The forest officers were keeping tabs on movement of this elephant, called
Priyanka, for nearly a year to gather evidence,” said a member of the
Wildlife SOS team.

COIMBATORE: A male elephant was electrocuted in Nellidurai in Mettupalayam
forest range on early Sunday morning.

Initially, it was suspected that the elephant, which was nearly
30-year-old, died of suffocation after it fell into an elephant proof
trench (EPT). However, the post-mortem reports on Sunday evening concluded
that the elephant was electrocuted.

A senior official of the forest department said, ""The elephant died during
the wee hours of Sunday. The department officers who were patrolling in the
area around 10.30am informed us.""

Another forest department official said, ""Initially it looked like the
elephant fell into the trench and died of suffocation."" He added, ""Later,
when post-mortem reports concluded that it died of electrocution we
realized that it fell into the trench due to electrocution.""

The area is frequented by elephants, the forest officials said. ""Last year,
two elephants died in the same region (within a 5km radius),"" the official
said. The live wire that electrocuted the elephant is said to be hanging
from a pole that was set to prevent entry of elephants, they added.

Bornean pygmy elephants are facing existential threats in Sabah and so the
death of any more wild elephants in the state is bad news. Yet just over
the past few months several wild elephants have been shot dead by poachers
or irate plantation workers.

Now another wild elephant is dead. The bull elephant, which was around six
years old, had been shot and ended up succumbing to his injuries before
staff at the Borneo Wildlife Sanctuary in Kinabatangan, where he was taken
for treatment, could save him.

“During the examination, a bullet slug was found lodged in its injured
front left leg,” explained Augustine Tuuga, director of the Sabah Wildlife
Department. “There were also sign of gunshots on the body but they did not
penetrate or cause any internal organ injury.”

The pachyderm also suffered an injury to his tongue, likely from a gunshot.
“While undergoing medical examination and treatment, its tongue was found
to have serious wound, believed to have been caused by a gunshot,” the
director said. “The wound on the tongue made the elephant unable to eat or
drink.”

The department’s rescue unit captured the elephant on November 24 at a
plantation in Ladang Pertama after he had been reported to be acting
aggressively towards locals in the area. He was showing signs of an injury
on his left front leg. After tracking the wild elephant for some time,
officials managed to capture him and took him to the wildlife sanctuary for
treatment. But by then it was too late for the animal.

It remains unknown who shot the elephant, but the likelihood is that it was
an irate plantation worker. “We will investigate the case further as it
involves the death of a totally protected species,” Tuuga said. The
elephant’s death is especially egregious as it comes shortly after another
bull elephant was found dead with three gunshot wounds at a large
plantation in Tawau, where another male elephant was also killed last
month, bringing the tally of dead elephants, all shot dead, to three within
the space of just a few weeks.

And so it goes: plantations have robbed wild elephants in the area of their
natural habitats, severely reducing their roaming grounds. As a result,
many of them can’t help but wander onto plantations, where they then
encounter locals who look askance at the pachyderms feeding on crops. Some
of these locals take matters into their own hands and shot the animals.

“When elephants come into conflict with people it is a battle in which the
gentle animals are destined to lose,” observes SM Mohd Idris, president of
the conservationist group Sahabat Alam Malaysia. “Those responsible for
land clearance are highly aware of the increased risks of elephants coming
into conflict with people and the subsequent fatalities that may arise,” he
adds. “Many plantation owners and farmers now see elephants as enemies, yet
it is humans, not the pachyderms, who are responsible for this situation.”",2

CUTTACK: The Wildlife Society of Odisha has urged the state government to
barricade open wells with a view to saving animals, especially the
elephants, which fall into them and die.

A large number of elephants and other wildlife animals are falling into
open wells, and in many cases, this leads to their death, said society
secretary Biswajit Mohanty on Monday.

On October 29, an elephant calf died after falling into an open well at
Madhapur under Athmalik forest division in Angul district. The carcass was
discovered after two to three days. On November 3, another jumbo calf fell
into an open well near Naharkanta under the Tangi forest range in Khurda
district. The calf survived as it was rescued.

On November 27, an adult female elephant that had fallen into an open well
at Tapursingha under the Athmalik forest division was rescued after a
marathon 10-hour operation. But unfortunately, the same elephant fell into
another open well a kilometre away the next day. It died before being
rescued. The society had carried out a survey, which indicated that since
December 12, 2012 there had been 63 open well incidents, in which 85
animals had fallen. While 42 of them were elephants, the rest were other
animals.

On October 26, two bear cubs fell into an open well near Badadeula in
Koraput municipality limits. Both were rescued, but one died and the other
got badly injured.

While most of the 85 animals were rescued, 12 animals, including seven
elephants, died. Other wild animals, which had fallen into open wells,
included sloth bear, rattle, pangolin, spotted and barking deer, wild boar,
monitor lizard, jungle cat and fishing cat, the survey indicated.

""We have already urged the state forest and environment minister to take
measures to address the problem through memorandums, along with a proposal
to barricade all such wells in the elephant habitats,"" Mohanty said.

""We are disappointed that despite our repeated pleas since four years, no
action has been taken to barricade these open wells,"" Mohanty further said.

According to the wildlife society, not more than Rs 1.5 crore is needed to
barricade 5,000 open wells in the state. ""This is a small amount
considering the fact that the state has about 2,000 elephants,"" Mohanty
said.",1

The Puttalam Wildlife Conservation Department Assistant Director W.M.K.S.

the postmortem examination had in his report identified the elephant's
death was caused by gunshot injuries to its liver and the resultant

TEXPUR: One person was arrested recently in connection with the death of
two elephants allegedly due to electrocution at Silghat under Borghat
Police station in Sonitpur district where they had gone in search of fodder.

According to Forest Department sources, two full-grown male and female
elephants came out from Kaziranga National Park in search of fodder and
entered the Chamodhora village in Silghat and were consuming paddy in the
paddy field. When they proceeded towards the nearby pond for drinking water
in the grounds of one Mukul Sarmah, the ill-fated elephants were
electrocuted to death.

Following the pathetic death of the elephants, the Sonitpur West Forest
Division reacted strongly and P. Shiv Kumar, Forest Conservator, Sonitpur
West Forest Division immediately ordered the local forest official inquire
into the incident, Forest department sources said.

 P Shiv Kumar, Forest Conservator, Sonitpur West Forest Division, further
said that the elephants died after being in contact with sagging
high-voltage 11KV electric wires kept in the pond by local resident Mukul
Sarmah.

The bodies have been sent for post-mortem. If the autopsy report finds
electrocution as the cause of the death, penal action would be initiated
against Mukul Sarmah.

“Lack of coordination between the local inhabitants in various parts of the
forest adjacent areas and forest department is proving fatal for the
itinerant animals,” P. Shiv Kumar said. Death of elephants by electrocution
has been a major cause of concern for forest personnel. The recurrence of
electrocution of jumbos is attributed to poor understanding between people
and the forest department in the State.

In forest fringe areas, live electric wires remain sagging at many places
and the protected parks and wildlife sanctuaries, conferred habitation
corridors of the elephants, face the onslaught of massive encroachment from
people who live and forage, or graze cattle in the forests. The human
interference of this nature is giving rise to frequent man-pachyderm
confrontation.",1

Conservation verses extinction: Where do jumbos stand today?

News of five tuskers being shot dead inside two weeks made headlines in
newspapers, thus raising doubts among authorities and experts in the field.
All these animals were killed in and around Puttalam District, with four
killings happening just after Dala Poottuwa’s body was found.

Whether it’s a warning sign to authorities or whether someone is trying to
exercise his power is still uncertain as the deliberate killing of the Dala
Poottuwa is still under investigation.

As an immediate measure to protect the rest of the tuskers, the Wildlife
and Sustainable Development Minister recently proposed the introduction of
GPS tracking collars.

The Minister has also made clear that the Department of Wildlife
Conservation (DWC) is short-staffed and that there are less people to go on
patrol. Such discrepancies in the system have given rise to more issues
pertaining to wildlife.

As a result wildlife enthusiasts are yet to know if proper monitoring is
done with regard to the use of collars. While experts are still weighing
the pros and cons associated with this technology, it is unclear as to
whether wildlife authorities are also ready to use such sophisticated
collars despite vandalism taking place.

In an attempt to shed light on this topic, the Daily Mirror, spoke to a few
experts in the field while also highlighting results of a research done on
the effectiveness of GPS tracking collars.

Speaking at a press conference held last week, subject minister Gamini
Jayawickrama Perera said that the ministry has received information about
several baby elephants being abandoned near Menik Ganga and few other
places in Hambantota.

“I’m yet to know who is behind these activities because it’s clear that
someone wants to retain baby elephants illegally. Thereafter, it’s easy for
them to transport baby elephants to Middle East countries. I will provide
all this information to the CID as well as to Interpol to commence
investigations immediately. As a signatory of the CITES Agreement we have
to be more responsible in conserving wildlife. The other disturbing fact is
that four other tuskers were killed soon after the Dala Poottuwa’s
incident. The CID is independently handling the investigation and I will
not disclose any information at this stage. One of these elephants was
poisoned, the other was shot and one of them was electrocuted. There are
several lawsuits currently underway and some people are trying to show that
there’s no protection for wild elephants. Another issue is the rapid
encroachment of their habitats by humans and as a result elephants have
become a threat to humans. In view of this I’m planning to submit a Cabinet
paper as well,” the minister said.

While commending the work of Dr. Prithiviraj Fernando and other elephant
researchers, the Minister further said that all tuskers will have a GPS
tracking collar in future. “We have spoken to various independent groups to
weigh the pros and cons of using these collars. Research on the use of
collars is still being carried out in countries such as Kenya. But as an
immediate measure, we have decided to put collars on all tuskers and
monitor their movements within those areas. There’s also a challenge of
upgrading the workforce in the DWC in order to ensure frequent monitoring
of these elephants. At the end of the day, DWC officials are blamed for any
discrepancy. We have forest reserves and national parks that have to be
protected. So I need the assistance of the Tri-forces to work with DWC
officials and go on patrols, especially at night, in order to give out a
message that they are always on the watch. DWC officials haven’t received
any training so far. Previously, new recruits had to go on these patrols
with veterans, but we don’t see this happening anymore. Therefore we have
to train them from scratch,” Perera said.

Speaking to the Daily Mirror, wildlife enthusiast and President of the
Wildlife and Nature Protection Society (WNPS) Rukshan Jayawardene said that
collared elephants have hardly been killed. “Collars could have cameras
that can photograph elephants. Sophisticated collars could be used, but
constant monitoring should take place. The recent killings of five tuskers
within two weeks is questionable. Although there tusks haven’t been
removed, except for those of the Dala Poottuwa, they could be smuggled to a
safe location. Nobody is willing to visit these places where they have been
killed. When the locations are exposed via media and the Police and other
authorities start investigating, these people get information faster than
the rest,” said Jayawardene.

Jayawardene further said that poachers and hunters don’t seem to carry
lucrative products. “In most instances it’s being given to them by someone
in power or someone who wants it to be delivered to another party. For
example Chinese tourists have been caught with various bio-matters such as
pangolin scales, wallapatta barks and other products. The Department needs
to rapidly deploy people in areas where these crimes take place. Elephants
are the wealth of this nation and nobody can give lame excuses every time
an elephant is killed,” said Jayawardene.

>From the above mentioned records it’s clearly evident that these incidents
took place in the Puttalam District. Therefore, allegations of an organized
group aiming at these tuskers fall into place.

As soon as the incident of the Dala Poottuwa made newspaper headlines, the
Daily Mirror, learned that the chief priest of Nikawewa Temple had gone
missing.

Several weeks afterwards, the CID is still carrying out investigations in
search of the suspects. At present, three of them are in custody.",1

TEZPUR: Two elephants were electrocuted in Assam's Nagaon district on
Monday night after coming into contact with an 11kV wire.

The incident occurred near the Assam Power Distribution Company Limited at
Samaguri Gandhali Kachari Gaon.

""The elephants, which were more than nine-foot tall, were coming from Karbi
Anglong in search of food. They were moving in a paddy field when their
trunks came in contact with the low-lying electric line and they were
electrocuted,"" a forest official said.

He said action would be taken against the power company.

Senior forest officials will discuss the issue of electrocution of
elephants at a high-level meeting convened by Dispur on Wednesday.

On December 8, an elephant had got electrocuted in Hojai while passing
through a paddy field as the contractor had diverted a transmission line.
On December 10, five elephants were knocked down by a speeding train near a
tea garden in Sonitpur district.

The government has no policy on preventing deaths of animals because of
train accidents and electrocution.

Former Union minister of state (independent charge) of environment, forest
and climate change, late Lagte Anil Madhav Dave, had informed the Rajya
Sabha last year that there was no policy with the government to formulate
such a policy.",1

BANDA ACEH (INDONESIA): A pregnant elephant has been found dead in a palm
oil plantation on Indonesia's Sumatra island, in what authorities suspect
was a deliberate poisoning, an official said today.

The animal's body was found near the remote Seuneubok Bayu village in Aceh
on December 22, after authorities received a tip off from locals, Aceh
conservation centre head Sapto Aji Prabowo told AFP.

""The 25-year-old elephant had been dead for around 10 days when we got
there,"" he said.

""From the autopsy, we saw that its digestive organs turned black which the
doctor said was a general indication of poisoning."" The Sumatran elephant
was carrying 13-month old male foetus and was at least six months short of
giving birth.

Locals have told authorities that several days before the carcass was
discovered farmers had complained an elephant ate their fertiliser.

Sumatran elephant are critically endangered and a protected species, but
rampant deforestation for plantations has reduced their natural habitat and
brought them into conflict with humans.

At least 11 wild elephants died in Aceh this year, most of them killed by
humans, according to Prabowo.

In January, authorities found a dead elephant without tusks in Aceh, along
with its abandoned 11-month-old calf.",1

TEZPUR: Man-elephant conflict in Sonitpur district is now turning
catastrophic for both elephants and humans.

The latest tragic incident of five elephants getting crushed by a train
near Balipara came close on the heels of a Bhalukpung-based ITBP jawan
dying an untimely death on December 3 when a wild tusker attacked his
Bhalukpung-based camp.

The deceased was identified as Paban Kumar of Haryana.Earlier, one Chandan
Das of Nameri Rihajuli was killed by a wild elephant while he was on way to
his friend’s home. The people of Mulangaon, Charidwar, Balipara,
Dhekerigaon, Dighali, Owholagaon, Gormora, Bogijuli, Bhakatgaon etc., under
Charidwar revenue circle near Nameri National Park are passing sleepless
nights for the last couple of months due to the pachyderm havoc. Herds of
wild elephants are damaging large areas of paddy fields and dwellings of
many families in the area.

It may be noted that since last year the problem has got aggravated as many
elephant-grazing areas and corridors have decreased. Of these places, the
Balipara AIDC area was an important and permanent elephant habitat spot.
However, after the area was given away in the name of development to
companies like Patanjali and Dabur India Limited, the wild elephants have
been facing problems in their habitat.

As this area was an elephant habitat, herds now enter the villages or tea
garden areas causing massive damages. To check the menace, the villagers
adopt certain unwanted ways like poisoning, digging of big trenches so that
elephants fall into it, electrocution etc. Till date, as a result of such
ways adopted by the villagers, many wild elephants have been killed.

Recently, a carcass of a wild elephant was found near Chatai railway track
in Nameri National Park. The carcass bore a number of bullet injuries of a
handmade gun. Forest department officials informed this reporter that the
bullets recovered from the body of the elephant carcass have been sent to
forensic science laboratory for proper investigation.

The common people of the area and the wildlife lovers like Sourav Barkataki
have expressed their total annoyance over the growing man-elephant conflict.",1

GUWAHATI: Every winter, the man-animal conflict escalates. As water sources
dry up, elephants venture into paddy fields for food and are poached or
killed.

In Assam, 916 people were killed by elephants and nearly 250 elephants
killed by humans or human-controlled devices since 2006. According to the
Assam forest department, the state has reported 80 human deaths in 2006 and
the figures rose to 118 in 2015, 110 in 2016 and 86 so far this year.

Subhash Hasda, 49, a farmer of Bhergaon village in Udalguri district, was
missing since Wednesday afternoon. His body was recovered on Thursday
morning from near a paddy field. He had been trampled to death by a herd of
at least 30 elephants which came down from a nearby hill. A few metres away
lay the carcass of a male elephant which probably came in contact with a
live wire.

On December 11, a speeding train mowed down five elephants when a herd was
crossing the tracks in Sonitpur.

The state has reported nearly 40 elephant deaths this year after the
animals were electrocuted or run over by speeding trains. Elephants also
die after attacks by villagers when houses and crops are damaged.

While conservationists blame growing pressure on the state's forests and
elephant reserves and increasing population of elephants, the state forest
department is struggling to tackle the acute problem. The elephant
population has increased from 5,246 in 2002 to 5,719 in 2017.

Forest minister Pramila Rani Brahma on Thursday said: ""I have asked the
electricity department to ensure that power lines are maintained properly.
I have also asked the railways to maintain speed limit in forest areas.""

NFR officials said they maintain speed limit in elephant corridors. ""We
have a WhatsApp group comprising forest and railway staff. We act quickly
if timely information about movement of elephants is provided by forest
personnel. It is neither possible to stop plying of trains or stop the
elephants abruptly,"" an official said.

The forest department has formed anti-depredation squads in each
subdivision and opened a toll free number (18003453980) for 24-hour help.",1

contractors’ cabin in Gerik yesterday, was a female leader of a pack that
was still breastfeeding her calf, an official has revealed today.

Perak Department of Wildlife and National Parks (Perhilitan) principal
assistant director Wan Shaharuddin Wan Nordin said the department came to
the conclusion as milk was coming out from its breast.

“We have no idea how old is her calf but those who saw the herd said the
elephant which died was part of a group of six or seven elephants,” he told
Malay Mail when contacted here.

“With the death of its mother, the calf will now be cared for by other
elephants in the group,” he added.

Wan Shaharuddin said initial investigations showed the female elephant,
which was more than 20 years old, had approached the cabin as it smelled
food.

“It tried to push down the cabin door to get to the food. The impact of the
push instead caused the electricity supplied to the cabin to land on it
thus electrocuting it,” he said.

Wan Shaharuddin added that the female pachyderm was most probably the
leader of the herd.

“Upon seeing the leader dead, the herd ran amok and destroyed the other
cabins in the area,” he explained.

It was reported that the female pachyderm, which weighed roughly two
tonnes, received a 240 volt shock from the electricity supplied to the
cabin.

The cabin, located around 100 metres away from the Seri Banding army camp,
was being used by contractors who were carrying out repair works on the
site of a recent landslide.

Malaysian Nature Society past president Prof Maketab Mohamed when contacted
said the tragedy would become the norm due to the conflict between man and
nature.

“Elephants are a regular feature along the Gerik to Jeli highway as the
pachyderms are not scared of humans. They used to eat food wastes dumped in
an illegal dump site along the highway,” he said.

The professor added that elephants cross the highway regularly at many
spots despite the presence of a wildlife viaduct, and explained that the
incident would not have occurred if the elephants had a place to go.

“Stopping all forest conversions would be good,” he quipped, adding that
suitable habitats are rarer by the day as more forests being converted to
other uses especially to oil palm plantations.",1

A young male elephant was found dead after getting stuck in a hole on
Monday afternoon in Mondulkiri’s Keo Seima Wildlife Sanctuary, according to
officials.

Dem Buntoeun, the sanctuary’s director, said the 1-year-old elephant had
already been removed, and the corpse was transported to the Ministry of
Environment in Phnom Penh for study.

“We felt deep regret after obtaining the report from border military forces
at O’Chum area saying that they encountered it dead because it was trapped
in a hole surrounded by bamboo bushes,” he said.

At first, he said, they suspected the hole was a trap set by hunters, but
upon inspection realised that the elephant had in fact stepped into a
termite nest which collapsed, trapping the two hind legs of the pachyderm
in a pit about one metre wide and a little over half a metre deep.

Given that the body had not begun to decompose, Bunteoun said, experts
estimate that the 200-kilogram elephant likely died on Sunday night or
early Monday morning.

Keo Sopheak, the Mondulkiri Environment Department director, said the
elephant’s body would be taxidermied and put on display for the young
generation to “study and research”.

According to the Wildlife Conservation Society some 250 to 500 globally
endangered wild Asian elephants remain in the Kingdom, with no more than
115 individuals in the Keo Seima Wildlife Sanctuary.

elephants in Cambodia are facing high risk due to habitat loss and snaring"".

""To protect this species, we need to safeguard their natural habitat with

communities to report information to the relevant authorities and

PALEMBANG, INDONESIA: Wildlife activists in Indonesia suspect poachers
poisoned an elephant found with its tusks hacked off in a protected forest
in southern Sumatra.

The body of the male Sumatran elephant (Elephas maximus sumatranus),
believed to be about 10 years old, was found Sunday by local farmers in a
community plantation within the Mount Raya protected forest area, which
borders Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park in South Sumatra province.

The park is also home to critically endangered Sumatran tigers (Panthera
tigris sondaica), rhinos (Dicerorhinus sumatrensis) and orangutans (Pongo
abelii), all of which faced increased threats from greater human incursion
into their habitats as a result of road projects.

Citing a lack of wounds on the body, wildlife activists believe the
elephant was killed by poisoning — a common tactic used by poachers in the
region.

Muhroni, a wildlife expert with the environmental NGO Jejak Indonesia, who
inspected the body, said the perpetrators likely sprayed the poison on
grass, small plants and bushes outside the community plantation. If that’s
the case, other elephants from the herd that the young male belonged to
could also be in danger, he warned.

Authorities are conducting tests to determine the cause of death.

The discovery on Sunday came less than a month after a pregnant elephant
was found dead in an oil palm plantation in Sumatra’s northernmost province
of Aceh on Dec. 22.

In that case, authorities said an autopsy showed general signs of
poisoning, including the digestive organs having turned black. The elephant
was an estimated 25 years old and believed to be at least six months short
of giving birth. It did not have tusks, as is typical for female Sumatran
elephants.

High rates of deforestation throughout much of Sumatra, primarily for
monoculture plantations such as oil palms, rubber and pulpwood, have driven
native wildlife from their habitats and into more frequent conflicts with
humans.

Orangutans and elephants, in particular, are seen as pests by farmers for
raiding crops and trampling plants. Locals have in many cases resorted to
poisoning or shooting the animals.

Poisoning is also used by poachers targeting the elephants’ tusks. The
average wholesale price for ivory in China, one of the key markets for the
commodity, was $730 per kilogram (2.2 pounds) in February 2017, according
to the Save the Elephants.

There are only an estimated 2,400 Sumatran elephants left in the wild,
scattered across 25 fragmented habitats on the island.",1

PRACHUAP KHIRI KHAN: Police are hunting down the gunmen who brutally killed
a wild elephant in a national park in Kui Buri district.

Provincial police chief Pol Maj Gen Pattana Petsayanawin on Monday set up
three teams of investigators to collect information and look for clues in
their manhunt for the killers of the 20-year-old beast. Soldiers are
joining the police in a combined effort to hunt down the perpetrators.

The male elephant was found dead in the Kui Buri National Park on Friday.

A preliminary autopsy by veterinarians from the National Park, Wildlife and
Plant Conservation Department found a rifle bullet and a shotgun bullet in
the body.

Police said they will examine firearm registrations in Kui Buri, Muang and
Samroi Yot districts as part of their investigation. Plantations in areas
adjacent to the national park have occasionally been raided by hungry wild
elephants.

Investigation chief Pol Col Chana Suwannakomol said angry farmers might be
to blame for the death. Srisawad Boonma, the kamnan of tambon Haad Kham
where the elephant's body was found, said local residents had learned how
to coexist with wild animals. The problem could come from outsiders who
entered the area, he suggested.

The park has filed a complaint with the Haad Kham police station on the
death of the elephant. Officials removed its tusks and took them to the Kui
Buri park office.

Monks from Wat Rai Bon held a religious ceremony on Sunday before the
animal was cremated in the forest. ""I pray that people and authorities will
help conserve elephants in Kui Buri. It was sad to see an elephant, our
national symbol, killed,"" abbot Phra Khru Dhammavipak said.",1

RANCHI/DALTONGANJ: A group of veterinary doctors and medical staff have
sighted an adult male elephant grievously injured by a possible landmine
explosion in the Palamu Tiger Reserve (PTR).

The bull elephant, sighted in the south division of PTR that is spread over
Latehar district in west Jharkhand, was sighted with wounds in his right
hind leg three days ago.

""The adult male elephant has wounds in right hind leg and is very
aggressive and restless. It is limping over the last three days,"" AK
Mishra, the deputy director of PTR's south division (additional charge),
told the TOI on Friday. However, Mishra could not definitively ascertain
the cause of the wound till evening.

However, foresters aware of the development said the wound looked like one
from a landmine blast.

Last September, another male elephant was injured in a landmine blast set
off by operatives of CPI (Maoists) in the core area of PTR. The jumbo
wandered around the sanctuary in pain for three days before succumbing to
its injuries.

The injury, which has left the animal in enormous pain, has also left it
greatly agitated. Its aggressive behavior is preventing the medical team
from getting closer, thereby worsening its chances of survival with every
passing minute.

""It travelled 10 kilometers across the sanctuary overnight and is in pain.
The medical team is tailing close to it. Finding an opportune moment, it
will be sedated using a tranquilizer gun. Only then its medication can be
started,"" a PTR forester said. PTR director MP Singh could be contacted
till evening.

PTR reported two jumbo deaths in 2017. In June, a male elephant died of
anthrax. The other pachyderm died of landmine explosion injuries.

Of the 555 elephants present in Jharkhand's wilds, nearly 190 reside in the
sanctuary. PTR, the only tiger sanctuary in Jharkhand, has been a safe
haven of left wing extremism outfits for more than a decade.",1

at Baresand in Palamau Tiger Reserve, has indicated the presence of
Left-wing extremists in Latehar's fabled animal hub hitherto not known to
be a sanctuary for Left-wing extremists.

Birsa zoo veterinary doctor Ajay Kumar, who rushed to Baresand on Saturday
for treating the tusker, said it was probably injured in a landmine
explosion on December 30 or 31 and was recovering without the help of
medication.

The incident confirms the presence of Maoist rebels in Palamau Tiger
Reserve area despite intensive combing operations. The rebels continue to
lay landmine traps that ate targetted at security forces but often end up
harming wild animals.

ADG (operations)-cum-police headquarter senior spokesman R.K. Mallick said
that all efforts were being made to flush out the rebels from the area.

In September 2017, an elephant succumbed to the injuries it sustained after
stepping on a landmine in Burha Pahar area, highlighting how vulnerable
animals in and around the tiger reserve are to continuing police-rebel
conflicts.

""The elephant is freely moving its legs and grazing. He also chases away
people trying to approach him. He seems to be enjoying his life in the
forest. There is no need to disturb him,"" Kumar said.

He feels giving medicines after administering tranquillisers may affect the
natural healing process.

""We came here fully prepared to begin treatment after tranquillising the
elephant, but we noticed that he was not bleeding. Rather he was moving
around without any problem,"" Kumar said.

The latest incident also underscores the necessity of a veterinary doctor
at the Palamau reserve, which has to fall back on Birsa zoo whenever an
ailing or injured animal is spotted.

A few months back, an ailing sambhar (spotted deer with long horns) was
spotted in the reserve. It died by the time a vet from Ranchi arrived after
around three days,"" a local reporter said.

PALEMBANG, INDONESIA: Wildlife activists in Indonesia suspect poachers
poisoned an elephant found with its tusks hacked off in a protected forest
in southern Sumatra.

The body of the male Sumatran elephant (Elephas maximus sumatranus),
believed to be about 10 years old, was found Sunday by local farmers in a
community plantation within the Mount Raya protected forest area, which
borders Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park in South Sumatra province.

The park is also home to critically endangered Sumatran tigers (Panthera
tigris sondaica), rhinos (Dicerorhinus sumatrensis) and orangutans (Pongo
abelii), all of which faced increased threats from greater human incursion
into their habitats as a result of road projects.

Citing a lack of wounds on the body, wildlife activists believe the
elephant was killed by poisoning — a common tactic used by poachers in the
region.

Muhroni, a wildlife expert with the environmental NGO Jejak Indonesia, who
inspected the body, said the perpetrators likely sprayed the poison on
grass, small plants and bushes outside the community plantation. If that’s
the case, other elephants from the herd that the young male belonged to
could also be in danger, he warned.

Authorities are conducting tests to determine the cause of death.

The discovery on Sunday came less than a month after a pregnant elephant
was found dead in an oil palm plantation in Sumatra’s northernmost province
of Aceh on Dec. 22.

In that case, authorities said an autopsy showed general signs of
poisoning, including the digestive organs having turned black. The elephant
was an estimated 25 years old and believed to be at least six months short
of giving birth. It did not have tusks, as is typical for female Sumatran
elephants.

High rates of deforestation throughout much of Sumatra, primarily for
monoculture plantations such as oil palms, rubber and pulpwood, have driven
native wildlife from their habitats and into more frequent conflicts with
humans.

Orangutans and elephants, in particular, are seen as pests by farmers for
raiding crops and trampling plants. Locals have in many cases resorted to
poisoning or shooting the animals.

Poisoning is also used by poachers targeting the elephants’ tusks. The
average wholesale price for ivory in China, one of the key markets for the
commodity, was $730 per kilogram (2.2 pounds) in February 2017, according
to the Save the Elephants.

There are only an estimated 2,400 Sumatran elephants left in the wild,
scattered across 25 fragmented habitats on the island.",0

Authorities Suspect Poisoning of Waterbody; Viscera Samples Sent for Tests
to Ascertain Cause of Death

Mystery shrouds the death of two tigers and an elephant whose carcasses
were found close to a waterbody in Bandipur Tiger Reserve on Thursday. The
deaths set alarm bells ringing among conservationists and the Forest
Department staff.

While the cause of death was yet to be confirmed, authorities have not
ruled out poisoning.

The carcasses were found close to the Hirekere waterbody in the Himmavad
Gopalswamy Betta range of the tiger reserve. The animals may have died a
week ago. The male tiger was around 3 years old, the female about 2 years,
and the elephant, a female, around 25 years old.

Conservator of Forests and Director of Bandipur Ambadi Madhav said
post-mortem was conducted and samples of the viscera will be sent to the
National Centre for Biological Sciences, Bengaluru, and the Forensic
Science Laboratory at Madiwala, to ascertain cause of deaths.

A section of senior officials said the waterbody may have been poisoned,
but some activists said the amount of poison required to contaminate the
waterbody would be huge. Besides, other animals dependent on it should have
died too.

Linked to Cattle Deaths?

There have been past incidents of tigers being poisoned to avenge cattle
deaths, and the authorities are yet to ascertain if any village in the
vicinity had reported cattle deaths recently.

Veterinarian Nagaraj, who conducted post-mortem, said the carcasses were so
putrefied that ascertaining cause of death through post-mortem was
difficult. The viscera samples may throw light on the cause.

Bandipur is one of the best landscapes for tigers, and harbours nearly 110
to 130 tigers, besides a rich density of elephants. But the national park
is also surrounded by nearly 150 villages, and hence conflicts are high.

Last year, as many as four tiger deaths were reported from Bandipur and 11
died in the adjoining Nagarahole.

Expressing shock over the development, activists questioned why money
generated through tourism was not being channelised to address the woes of
the local community.

“Though Bandipur generates nearly ₹5 crore from tourism, and the funds are
to be channelised through the Bandipur Tiger Foundation for local community
development, nothing is done for their benefit,” said a conservationist on
condition of anonymity.

On January 27, a week after the conclusion of the Makaravilakku festival at
Sabarimala, a 20-year old female elephant was found dead near
Valiyanavattom hardly one kilometre away from the sewage treatment plant at
Pamba.

The post-mortem examination of the carcass revealed that it died after
large quantity of plastic blocked its alimentary canal, resulting in
internal bleeding and failure of the vital organs. Though it is the only,
and the first death of the mammal after the complete plastic ban in
Sabarimala by the high court in 2016, the forest officials have found that
plastic is a key content in the dung of the mammal all over forest region
covering the hill shrine.

""Plastic waste is a common sight after the season all along the route from
Pamba to Sannidhanam, Azhutha to Pamba and other forest routes. Though the
cleaning-up is happening along the routes after the season, the plastic
that moves to interior areas are posing a threat to the wildlife,"" said
Georgi P Mathachen, field director of forest department.

The elephants are attracted by food waste, especially those with salt
content like packed foods. They have been found to consume plastic even
from inside the incinerator shed.

The forest department in 2016 had filed an affidavit before the high court
after a Sambhar deer died after consuming plastic, on the basis of which
the high court imposed a total plastic ban in Sabarimala. But despite this,
loads of plastic bottles and packets are still dumped in and around the
shrine, after the pilgrimage season.

Travancore Devaswom Board, however, blamed the forest department for the
elephant death. ""In the case of the elephant that died, three-metre long
plastic sheet used by shopkeepers at Valiyanavattom and Cheriyanavattom was
found in its intestine. The shops are leased out by the forest department.
They are not doing anything to ensure that plastic waste is properly
disposed of,"" said A Padmakumar, president, TDB.

The Travancore Devaswom Board has blamed the forest department for the
presence of plastic materials in the forest path leading to Sabarimala and
the death of a cow elephant after it consumed plastic waste at
Valiyanavattom over a week ago.

TDB president A. Padmakumar told Deccan Chronicle that the place where the
cow elephant died comes under the jurisdiction of the forest department.
""Hence, the department is responsible for its death,"" he added. The carcass
was found at Valianavattom, hardly two km from Pampa, and plastic waste was
found in the lesions of the elephant.

The places where there is major presence of the plastic materials come
under the forest department and the TDB cannot do anything to remove them.
We have sanitised the places coming under us,"" Mr Padmakumar said.

The plastic materials left behind by the pilgrims at Cheriyanavattom, the
forest path from Pampa to Sannidhanam, and the premises of Sannidhanam up
to Orakkuzhy are posing a major threat to the wild animals, including
elephants.

An officer of the forest department said that the department was not doing
enough to clean the plastics. It may be recalled that the use of plastic
products is banned in Pampa and Sabarimala.

The 7-km forest path from Pampa to Sannidhanam is a dumping ground for
plastic waste. Both the TDB and the forest department have permitted shops
to function at places from Pampa to Sannidhanam.

The forest department had deputed 15 tribal people from the Attathodu
tribal settlement colony to clean the places, but the quantity of wastes is
huge, sources said.

The route from Kalaketty to Cheriyanavattom is also littered with waste.
Earlier, the wild elephants used to consume plastic waste from the sewage
treatment plant of the TDB at Cheriyanavattom before it was made functional.

The forest department will continue to sanitise the forest path to
Sabarimala from Kalakatty to Cheriyanavattom, said sources.

An elephant from the critically endangered Sumatran species has been found
dead inside an Indonesian national park with what appear to be bullet
wounds, the environment ministry said Wednesday.

The female elephant was discovered in Sumatra's Way Kambas National Park on
Monday.

Her trunk was broken off and she had five holes resembling gunshot wounds
on the right side of her body, it said.

But no bullets were found inside the body, which officials suspect had been
lying in the forest for at least two days.

""Its teeth were gone, maybe taken by hunters. So we assume she was shot
because of that, but we still need to investigate more,"" environment
ministry spokesman Djati Witjaksono Hadi told AFP.

The apparent killing of the elephant, believed to be about 20 years old,
comes about two months after a pregnant elephant was found dead in a palm
oil plantation in Sumatra.

The death was presumed to be the result of deliberate poisoning.

Also last year, authorities found a dead elephant without tusks in Aceh,
along with its abandoned 11-month-old calf.

Sumatran elephants are listed as critically endangered animals by the
International Union for the Conservation of Nature.

Massive deforestation for plantations has reduced their natural habitat and
brought them into conflict with humans. Their tusks are also targets for
poachers in the illegal ivory trade.

Way Kambas National Park is home to Sumatran elephants and also critically
endangered Sumatran tigers, Sumatran rhinos and endangered Asian tapirs.

There are believed to be around 2,000 Sumatran elephants left in the wild",1

CUTTACK: Forest officials on Tuesday found a carcass of a tusker from the
Gopapur forest in the Kalima Reserve Forest under the Badamba Range with
the tusks having been stolen by poachers.

The forest officials said the tusker had been killed 10 to 12 days back by
the poachers. It is the second incident within a week in which the poachers
have been successful in killing elephants and taking away their tusks.

Sources said the forest officials were trying hard to hide the matter and
were not receiving phone calls. It might be mentioned that earlier on
February 20, carcass of a tusker was also found and its tusks were stolen.

Locals alleged that though another such incident has been occurred twice in
close intervals, the higher authorities are still unvigilant in the matter.

Some locals found the carcass of the 8-year-old jumbo near the cyclone
shelter of the village and informed the forest officials.

Though the exact cause of the death of the pachyderm is yet to be known,
police and forest personnel suspect that the animal might have died due to
electrocution as a 33 KV electric wire has passed through the area.
However, the exact reason behind the death of the elephant can be known
post the autopsy.

“We got information about the elephant’s death from the locals. We do not
know under what circumstances the animal has died. However, experts from
OUAT (Bhubaneswar) will conduct the postmortem following which we will come
to know the reason of the animal’s death,” said Khuntuni range officer.

Forest officials on Tuesday found the carcass of a tusker from the
Haladiaseni Reserve Forest under the Badamba Range. The tusks of the
elephant were stolen by the poachers.

Sources said the poachers had killed the pachyderm ten days ago and stolen
its tusks. After recovering the carcass, Athagarh DFO Arun Kumar Swain, ACF
Rajendra Das and Badamba Ranger Govinda Chandra Ratha had directed for
holding of an autopsy of the animal.

Veterinary Surgeon Dr Nihar Ranjan Dash, after the autopsy, said several
injury marks were spotted on the body of the tusker and more details about
its death could be ascertained after release of the viscera report.

However, locals alleged that as no forest patrolling is being done in the
Athagarh Forest Division since long, not only animals but also the entire
jungle is now in the grip of the mafias and poachers.

They also alleged that some unscrupulous forest officials are hands in
glove with the mafias and poachers in loot of the jungle and death of
animals.

The locals pointed out that if the forest is not guarded, the innocent
animals like deer, wild boars and hares would continue to be easy prey to
the poachers. They demanded that the higher authorities remain vigilant in
the matter.

JORHAT: The carcass of two adult male elephants, who have been electrocuted
to death, were found in a tea garden in Karbi Anglong district on Monday
morning.

The incident took place at around 3am on Monday at Dhansiri tea garden,
about 25 km from Bokajan town, under Borpathar police station.

Members of the forest staff said the elephants had visited the tea garden
in search of food and came in contact with a high volt electric wire while
they were returning to the forest.

""Both the elephants were adult males. Preliminary investigations suggest
the trunks of the elephants touched the live wire while passing through the
tea garden. They were killed on the spot,"" said a forest officer in Karbi
Anglong.

A wild elephant was brutally killed in Ngaputaw township, Ayeyarwady
Region, despite the announcement of a K3 million reward for information
leading to the arrest of elephant poachers.

On March 12, a local reported the killing of an elephant to the region’s
forest department. The animal was skinned and its tusks were removed,
according to the forest department.

The department and other governmental agencies are currently investigating
the matter, according to U Khun Pyone Naing, officer of the Ngaputaw forest
department.

“Most hunters are not locals. They come from other areas and persuade
locals to collaborate through bribery,” he added.

In Ngaputaw township, three wild elephants were killed since January,
officials said.

U Khun Pyone Naing asked for the villagers’ cooperation to fight the plight
of illegal wildlife trade and to protect endangered species.

“Before this elephant, two hunters who tried to kill elephants were
arrested thanks to the cooperation of locals after the reward was
advertised,” said U Khun Pyone naing.

Friends of Wildlife (FOW), World Wildlife Fund and the forest department
are cooperating to reduce wildlife hunting by putting up posters which
read: “Please, help and cooperate to reduce the killing of wild elephants
and get a chance to receive K3 million by providing information on the
whereabouts of the hunters”.

Posters are displayed in Ayeyarwady Region’s Ngaputaw and Thapaung
townships, according to FOW, which added that killings of elephants are
still ongoing.

Last year, 29 hunters were arrested and 12 wild elephants were killed while
six died of natural causes in Ayeyarwady Region, according to forest
department.

“The hunters arrested will be judged according to the laws such as the
protection of wildlife and conservation natural areas law,” said U Khin
Maung Myint, director of the Ayeyarwady Region forest department.

COIMBATORE: A male elephant was today found dead in a farm near here amid
suspicion that it could have been electrocuted after coming into contact
with an electrified fence, police said.

Forest Department officials from Madukarai went to the farm and noticed it
had an electrified fence.

They suspected that the elephant, about 25 years old, could have died of
electrocution or due to any disease.

The animal may have strayed into the private pumpkin farm in Mathipalayam
village, owned by one Chandran, to consume the vegetable, police said.

There have been incidents in the recent past of elephants and other animals
being electrocuted after coming into contact with such fences.

In some instances, cases have been registered against farm owners.

A tusker, which had entered a private plantation in Palangaala village in
Virajpet taluk of Kodagu district, was found shot dead on Thursday.

The tusker was around 25 to 30 years old. Deputy Conservator of Forests of
Virajpet D. Maria Christu Raja confirmed that it was shot dead but they
were yet to recover the bullet from the scene of crime. The elephant had
died in a kneeling position, lending credence to the suspicion that the
bullet had killed it instantly.

Post-mortem was under way late on Thursday and a complaint has been
registered with the Judicial Magistrate First Class at Virajpet. The
authorities said no arrests had been made yet.

Incidents of human-elephant conflict are high in Kodagu and the presence of
elephant herds in coffee plantations has also caused concern among the
local community. Incidentally, the Synchronized Asian Elephant Census
conducted last year included, for the first time, elephant count exercise
in coffee plantations.

Carcasses of two tuskers and a leopard were found from Haridwar forest
division, adjoining Rajaji Tiger Reserve, within a span of 24 hours, a
forest official said on Monday.

One of the tuskers was electrocuted while the other pachyderm and the
leopard cub died of natural causes, the official said.

A tusker of about 18 years old was electrocuted on Monday afternoon in a
wheat field in Jeopota village, Pathri range of Haridwar forest division.

The owner of the wheat field, Rajendra Chauan, had left high tension wires
in the field. The forest department has booked him under The Wildlife
Protection Act, 1972.

“We are searching for the farmer on whose field the incident happened. He
is non-traceable,” said Akash Varma, divisional forest officer (DFO),
Haridwar.

People close to the matter said many farmers have put electric wires in
their farms to keep wild animals like leopards, monkeys and even elephants
at bay.

However, the farmers were never briefed on the current restriction owing to
which this animal died.

The act of putting electric wires in the field is termed as ‘hunting’ and
therefore, if needed the officers will also take support from the police in
this regard.

Another tusker was found dead on Sunday night near Jhilmil Jheel
Consevation Reserve. It had fallen into a pit.

When the forest staff tried to approach the pit late in the night, the
herds kept them away from rescuing the animal. On Monday morning, when the
staff reached the spot, the 15-year-old healthy tusker had died.

“The animal must have fallen into the pit because of which it died. The
post-mortem report could confirm the actual reason of its death,” Varma
said.

With this, Uttarakhand lost 6 elephants so far. Three deaths were reported
from Rajaji, one from Haldwani and two from Haridwar range.

The state reported 1,346 wild elephants in 2012 which swelled to 1,839 in
2017 national census.

Meanwhile, the carcass of a leopard cub was recovered from Rasiabad area of
the division.

Preliminary investigation said the animal had parasites and maggots inside
its elementary canal and it was very weak. Cubs below 2 years old remain
vulnerable in forest and often weak ones are abandoned by their mothers,
scientists said.

A 30-year old bull elephant wellknown among villagers in Tambon Pluang
Thong of Chon Buri’s Bo Thong district for its single ivory tusk and
shortened tail was killed, believed electrocuted, at a pineapple plantation
in Village Two of Tambon Pluang Thong on Sunday(Apr 15).

Officials of the Department of National Parks, Wildlife and Plants
Conservation based in Si Racha district were alerted of the jumbo’death by
villagers in Tam,bon Pluang Thong and a team was immediately sent to the
scene to investigate.

Mr Yu Senatham, head of the Si Racha office, said officials had collected
samples of vital organs of the dead elephant to be sent to the department’s
laboratory for examination to determine the cause of its death.

But he said he suspected the elephant was electrocuted and a complaint
would be lodged with Bo Thong police to look for the perpetrator.

A one-minute clip posted in the social media by officials of Ang Runai
wildlife sanctuary after Sunday’s tragedy shows the animal of being
friendly and good- tempered and a familiar figure in Chon Buri and Rayong.

Meanwhile, an informed police source said that the elephant’s trunk was
badly burned, suggesting that it was electrocuted. He said that the
elephant was found dead about 100 metres from the burial site of another
jumbo which was electrocuted on March 25.

A guard of the pineapple plantation where the dead elephant was found on
Sunday, identified as Samin Chansamut, 45, was arrested by the police
allegedly for discharging electricity into the barbed wire fence of the
plantation which killed the elephant on March 25.

The case against him is still pending in the court.

Officials suspected that Samin might be responsible for the Sunday’s death
of the one-tusk elephant and would urge the police to look for him for
interrogation.

for nearly 4 days, they were unable to save its life.

Investigations are now underway to arrest the culprits involved in the
tusker’s death.

A male elephant was electrocuted after coming into contact with an illegal
high voltage electrified fence put up around a farm in the Sathyamangalam
Tiger Reserve (STR) in this district, Forest officials said today.

The pachyderm, believed to be 11 years old, was found dead yesterday in
Neithalapuram village near Thalawady and a veterinarian declared it had
died of electrocution, officials said.

A case had been registered against the farm owner, Karuppana Gounder, who
is reportedly absconding, they said.

Some farmers in forest fringes put up such fences, which are illegal, to
prevent wild animals from damaging crops.

Though rules permit energising fences with low voltage to give a mild shock
to animals to prevent them from entering farms, often the farmers resort to
installing 230 volt fencing, which result in fatalities.

There have been several incidents in Tamil Nadu in the past of elephants
and other animals being electrocuted after coming into contact with such
fences.

In some instances, farm owners have been arrested.

DALTONGANJ: The forest guards of south division of Palamau Tiger Reserve
have spotted an injured adult elephant in the Burha Pahar range but can't
do much to help it unless the jumbo leaves the rebel-infested area on its
own.

The elephant, which was spotted on Thursday, has an injury on its right
hind leg that it finds difficult to put down.

The cause of the injury is yet to be ascertained.

M.K. Mahaling, deputy director of the south division of PTR, no forest
guard can enter the Burha Pahar range, dotted with Maoist landmines,
without the permission of the security forces.

He said the guards were waiting for the elephant to co-me back to the safe
zone of PTR where Ajay Kumar, a doctor of Bhagwan Birsa Biological Park in
Ormanjhi, has been requested to come over to examine it.

""We don't know about the nature or condition of the wound except that the
elephant is down with serious problem in its right hind leg,"" Mahaling
added.

Sources said one PTR elephant had succumbed to its injuries that it had
sustained in a land mine explosion last year.

BENGALURU: In the past few days, two species — a leopard and an elephant —
have been snared and electrocuted respectively in the Chikkamagaluru
territorial division.

This division alone has seen electrocution of eight elephants and snaring
of 12 leopards in the last decade.

Conservationists have expressed serious concerns on the lack of protective
measures in the state forests of Churchegudda and encroached forests of
Kamenahalli, as well as other ranges in this division.

Recently, a leopard was caught in a snare at Dasarahalli in Churchegudda
state forest, wherein, the villagers reported seeing the leopard roaming
with a live snare tangled around its neck.

The leopard had escaped from the snare but could not escape death. Forest
officials say hunters had fixed a snare in the fencing around Pavithravana
forest.

On Wednesday, a 20-year-old tusker was found electrocuted in Hirebidre
village of Kamenahalli forests.

This happened in the encroached forest lands of farmer Thamaiah.

He had illegally electrified the fence around this farm to protect his
ginger crops. Officials add that the absconding land owner Shivaraj, who
had earlier shot a tusker in the village in 2015, had leased this land to
Thamaiah for growing ginger.

Wildlife conservationist G Veeresh added, “Snaring is a silent killer of
wild animals and hunters/smugglers are using this method quite often in
forest areas and fields adjacent to tiger reserves, national parks and
reserve forest areas. Wildlife traders install snares usually to trap big
cats and so, it is also a question of survival of tigers. The forest
department should take note of this and pass strict orders for banning
usage of electrified fences in farm lands adjoining forests.”

Activists allege that for the last 10 years, snaring, electrocution and
poisoning of wild species, including big cats, are on the rise. “Protection
measures are pretty low in critical areas, while officials are
concentrating on plantation work and other civil works. So people have
started killing wild animals without any fear.”

Meanwhile, Chikkamagaluru Range ACF Ramesh Babu said, “Investigations are
on. Cases have been booked in both the incidents. Both Thamaiah and
Shivaraj are absconding, they will be arrested soon. Combing operations in
coordination with a Bengaluru NGO, who are specialists in snares, will
begin soon and will be done for two days. As far as electrified fences are
concerned, we are always on the lookout but it is very tough as farmers
switch on power any time resulting in such deaths.”

KOTA TINGGI: An adult female elephant died after the startled animal
charged a trailer at Batu 13 along the Jalan Mersing-Kota Tinggi road here.

Johor Department of Wildlife and National Parks (Perhilitan) director
Jamalun Nasir Ibrahim said the incident occurred near the Panti forest
reserve at around 2am on Monday morning (May 21).

He said initial investigations found that the incident happened when the
driver of another car turned on the high beam of his headlights when he saw
a herd of elephants crossing the road.

“This startled one of the elephants and it was hit by a trailer which was
travelling from Terengganu to Singapore. The elephant died at the scene and
was less than ten years old,” said Jamalun.

He advised any road users not to provoke animals by honking or turning on
their high beam to avoid startling the animal and provoking it to attack.

Kota Tinggi OCPD Supt Ashmon Bajah confirmed that the incident took place
and said the driver did not suffer any injuries.

HANUR: The officials of Male Mahadeshwara Wildlife Division have arrested a
person yesterday for stealing tusks from a tusker, which had died after its
leg was lodged between the rocks when it had come to quench its thirst.

The accused had hidden the tusks in his house.

The accused has been identified as 53-year-old Sannaputta, son of Giriponda
and a resident of Solekobe village near Ramapura.

The incident: About two days ago, a tusker, aged about 15 years, had come
to the waterhole at Soleragudda forest area to drink water during which one
of its legs got stuck in between the rocks.

Unable to remove its leg, the tusker which grew weak, had died there with
its leg still stuck between the rocks. This incident had not come to the
notice of the Forest Department.

Yesterday morning, Sannaputta had entered the forest illegally to procure
seege soppu and saw the tusker dead. He then chopped the tusks and took it
to his home to sell them and make some money.

But at about 1 pm on the same day, the Forest staff, who were on their
regular beat, saw the dead tusker and upon going near it, they saw the
tusks missing and informed their higher officials.

DCF V. Yedukondalu, RFO Sundar and staff, who rushed to the spot, conducted
an inspection and following a tip off, they raided the house of Sannaputta
and seized the tusks besides registering a case against him.

It is learnt that Sannaputta has cases registered against him pertaining to
illegal storage of arms and ammunition and illegal entry into forests among
other cases.

A female elephant died inside a human settlement in Cherambadi near
Pandalur in the Nilgiris on Sunday morning.

C. Manoharan, Forest Range Officer (in-charge), Cherambadi Range, said the
elephant, said to be between 25 and 30-years-old, had been unwell for the
past three days and was straying close to the human settlements near
Padacheri in Pandalur.

In Search of Food

Forest watchers had been posted to monitor its health and to prevent humans
from getting too close to it. However, on Sunday morning, it had tried to
enter a house in the area, possibly in search of food or water, forest
department officials said.

As the animal was weak, it is believed to have fallen on a compound wall of
a house, and was unable to get up. Forest department staff, informed of the
incident, rushed to the spot.

After finding it was still alive, officials asked forest veterinarians for
their advice on how to treat it. “Using a crane, we managed to get the
elephant back on its feet, and decided to move it to a forest patch near a
water source on a flatbed truck, hoping that with medication and other
assistance, the animal would recover,” said Mr. Manoharan.

However, shortly after it was moved, it began having spasms and died, he
added.

Forest department officials said more than 10 forest department personnel,
and two rangers, including Mr. Manoharan and P. Ganeshan, Forest Range
Officer, Forest Protection Squad, were involved in the efforts to treat the
animal for over three hours before it finally died.

Veterinarian K.P. Prabhu performed the post-mortem.

While officials said the actual cause of death would only become known
later, they believed that the animal was unwell and unable to eat, causing
it to lose weight.

They said it was in an emaciated condition when it was spotted a couple of
days ago.

An elephant and its calf were found dead in the Cumbum East forest range,
part of Meghamalai division, on Monday.

S. Kalanithi, Wildlife Warden, Meghamalai, said a 25-year-old elephant and
her two-year-old calf were electrocuted near Venniyar Estate in the Cumbum
area.

“Post-mortem reports show that the elephants died 15-20 days ago. A
low-lying electrical grid line passes through this area. When the elephants
came in contact with the line they were immediately electrocuted,” he said.

Officials said they were not aware of the death because the incident
happened deep inside the forest.

The postmortem took nearly 10 hours. The Wildlife Warden said the Forest
Department would write to the Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution
Corporation to ensure that power lines were laid carefully in protected
areas.

A male elephant was found dead from poisoning in East Aceh, Aceh, on
Sunday. One of its tusks had been removed.

Bunta, 27, was part of the Conservation Response Unit (CRU) elephant team,
which wards off wild elephants trying to enter the area. Bunta and three
other elephants had been stationed at CRU Serbajadi in Bunin village,
Serbajadi district, East Aceh, Aceh, since January 2016.

The team was tasked with preventing animal-human conflicts in the area.
Bunta was the main police elephant at CRU Serbajadi, which was visited by
Hollywood actor Leonardo Di Caprio in March 2016.

Based on information provided by the CRU Serbajadi team on Sunday, Bunta
was found dead when a mahout went to relocate him from a forest located 500
meters from the CRU base camp to another area at 8 a.m. local time.

He saw Bunta lying on the ground dead with one of his tusks missing. The
mahout reported the incident to the Serbajadi Police, who forwarded the
report to the East Aceh Police.

East Aceh Police chief Adj. Sr. Comr. Wahyu Kuncoro said it appeared that
the elephant had eaten poison-laced bananas and mangoes. ""We are waiting
for the […] the Aceh Natural Resources Conservation Agency's veterinarian
team to reveal cause of death.""

MALAPPURAM: At a time the local people in forest border areas of Nilambur
are intensifying their protest demanding to install electric fencing in
border areas to prevent entry of wild elephants in farm lands, a 15-year
old elephant was electrocuted from electric fencing in the region, on
Sunday night.

The incident occurred near Padukka forest station in Moothedam panchayat.
The forest authorities have registered a case related to the incident and
started detailed investigation to ascertain the real reason for the
electrocution.

Divisional forest officer of Nilambur (South) V P Sajikumar said that the
preliminary examination of the carcass of animal shows that the death was
due to electrocution.

“There was a power fencing installed by forest authorities in the region
and the animal was found trapped in wires of the power fencing. We suspect
that the animal maintained contact with the wires for a many hours, that
led to death”, he said adding that only detailed investigation will reveal
the real reason for the death.

Hundreds of locals including tribals in forest bordering villages in
Moothedam, Marutha and Edakara regions are spending sleepless nights for
last some days, as wild tuskers are moving through human habitations,
mainly in search of jackfruit.

The herd of elephants which already caused damage of acres of land is still
wandering in the area. Fresh incidents of attack of wild tuskers are
reported in Aranadam Padam, Unichantham, Maddalappara and Marutha areas.

Plantain trees, arecanut trees and coconut trees in acres of area in
Aranadam Padam were destroyed when a tusker unleashed attack in the region
on Saturday.

As tusker is roaming around the region for last one week, local protesters
are demanding to re-install electric fencing in the forest border area.

Huge loss of crops was reported in Maddalappara region of Marutha, when
herd of elephants unleashed attack in the region on Saturday night.

The elephants entered the human inhabited areas in forest border around
10pm on Saturday, after destroying electric fencing in the region and the

Deega Danthu I, one of the elephants with the longest tusks roaming the
Kala Wewa National Park, was found with gunshot injuries on Monday,
Galkiriyagama Wildlife Warden D. Ranasinghe said.

Speaking to the Daily Mirror, he said the Galkiriyagama Wildlife Department
had been informed by several fishermen in the Kala Wewa area about a
wounded tusker, which was limping.

Deega Danthu was one of the 18 tuskers living in the Kala Wewa National
Park.

“As soon as we got the message, a team led by Galkiriyagama Wildlife
officers, Civil Defence Force officers and veterinary officers of
Pandulagama were sent to the location along with several villagers,” Mr
Ranasinghe said.

“At the time we reached the location, the elephant was found in a critical
condition due to the injuries sustained on its front left leg,” he said.

The medical team had treated the tusker on Tuesday (12) morning.

“The elephant is now recovering well following the treatment. There are
many licensed guns among the people living near the Kala Wewa National
Park. This injury cannot be from a licensed gun, but from a trap gun used
to kill wild animals illegally,” he said.

Following the investigation conducted by the Wildlife officers, they found
the elephant had been injured by a trap gun in the Kahagalle forest area in
the Kala Wewa National Park.

It was reported that the tusker used to enter villages searching for food
and it had no fear of the methods adopted by the villagers to chase him
away.

Mr Ranasinghe said there was no use of creating electric fences for tuskers
because tuskers use their tusks to trample the electrified fence.

“Tusks do not pass electric shocks. Therefore, they remove electric fences
using their tusks and enter villages to in search of food,” he said.

UDHAGAMANDALAM: An injured tusker that was found lying on a forest road in
Cherambadi forest range in Pandalur taluk in the Nilgiris on Tuesday, died
on Wednesday without responding to treatment.

The animal, aged around 12 years, died around 1.30pm, local veterinarians
who treated it, said.

Senior forest veterinarian NS Manoharan, who led a team of veterinarians to
conduct an autopsy, said the left lower jaw of the elephant was badly
fractured.

“We found the molar teeth of the animal dislodged and the oral cavity
severely infected. Formation of pus in the oral cavity was found up to the
skull,” he told TOI.

Veterinarians from the animal husbandry and animal disease investigation
unit were part of the post mortem team, besides forest department officials.

According to Manoharan, the animal must have suffered injuries about 10
days ago. “Infighting was ruled out after inspecting the nature of the
injuries,” he said.

Meanwhile, wildlife activists said the elephant might have suffered
injuries from a country bomb.

“A country bomb planted somewhere close to the forest area might have gone
off while the elephant was very close to the spot. It is a very serious
issue and the forest department should investigate it,” an activist said.

A female elephant aged about 60 years, which had come in search of food and
water, died after being electrocuted at Chikkabaragi village coming under
Hediyala Forest Range in Bandipur Tiger Reserve on June 20.

The elephant tried to enter the farm of one Shivallamma in search of
fodder. Shivallamma had erected a fence around the farm and had connected
power to it illegally. The elephant, which tried to enter the farm, came in
contact with the powered fence and died, according to sources in the Forest
Department.

Hediyala ACF K. Paramesh and staff, Veterinarian Dr. Nagaraju and National
Tiger Conservation Authority Member Raghuram visited the spot.

Dr. Nagaraju conducted the post-mortem and the carcass of the elephant was
buried. A case has been registered in this regard.

The carcass of a wild elephant was recovered at No 3 Pub Guwabari along the
Indo-Bhutan border under the Tamulpur forest range in Baksa district on
Sunday morning.

It may be mentioned that a huge herd of wild elephants has been moving from
place to place in the greater Nagrijuli area in Baksa district along the
Indo-Bhutan international border for the last two weeks in search of food.

The herd of wild elephants has been continuously creating fear-psychosis
among the villagers in the Nagrijuli area and several houses have also been
destroyed by the wild elephants.

A large number of people gathered at the spot where the wild elephant was
found dead and mourned the death of the wild elephant.

The forest officials also arrived at the place and recovered the carcass of
the wild elephant.

Later the forest officials made arrangement for post-mortem of the wild
elephant.

However, till filing of this report, it is yet to be ascertained the actual
cause of the wild elephant’s death.

However, the locals suspect that the wild elephant might have died due to
electric shock.

It may be mentioned that wild elephants come down from Bhutan side to the
plain areas in Baksa and come into conflict with human beings as a result
of which in last 15 years at least 70 people and 7 wild elephants have died
in the Tamulpur Sub-division under Baksa district alone.

“But no preventive measure has been taken by State Government and the
Forest Department to control the elephant menace. People have been using
metal wire, connected with battery and inverters which have been hanged in
the boundary of their villages to protect their houses and property,” said
sources.

On Sunday also, a huge herd of wild elephants was seen moving around the
Nagrijuli area. Villagers have demanded that the villagers of the area be
protected by the Government and the Forest department.

A critically endangered elephant has been found dead in a palm oil
plantation on Indonesia's Sumatra island in what is suspected to be a
deliberate poisoning, an official said Friday.

The 10-year-old female Sumatran elephant was found in Jambo Reuhat village
in North Aceh on Thursday -- the third of its species to be found dead of
suspected poisoning in the same palm plantation since 2015.

""We found fruits and a pouch with traces of powder inside the animal,"" Aceh
conservation centre head Sapto Aji Prabowo told AFP.

""We suspect the death was caused by deliberate poisoning because her liver
and spleen turned dark, a classic sign of poison,"" he added.

A group of veterinarians was deployed to the location after authorities
were tipped off by locals.

Officials estimated the animal had been dead for three days when the
carcass was discovered.

Sumatran elephants are a critically endangered species. Rampant
deforestation to create plantations has reduced their natural habitat and
brought them into conflict with humans.

At least 11 wild elephants died in Aceh last year, most of them killed by
humans.

Earlier in June a tame Sumatran elephant was found dead from apparent
poisoning in East Aceh district with its tusks missing.

Officials found the remains of fruits laced with poison inside the animal
during the autopsy.

The environment ministry estimates only around 500 Sumatran elephant remain
in Aceh.

A female wild elephant aged three years was found dead in a well at
Kaithapara in the Thodupuzha range of the Kothamangalam forest division on
Sunday.

The well had no protective wall.

A nearby house was found damaged by the wild elephants.

The residents of the house were away in Ernakulam for medical treatment. It
is suspected that two elephants intruded into the area and the female
elephant accidentally fell into the well.

A post-mortem examination would be conducted on Monday, said Kothamangalam

PATHANAMTHITTA:  The death of an elephant calf that got separated from its
herd in Moozhiyar forest in Pathanamthitta district had become news
recently.

The visuals that are doing the rounds of social media have opened up a new
debate on its death. The images suggest that the calf died due to the
unscientific manner in which it was dealt with by its rescuers and not due
to insufficient nutrition as was reported earlier.

Social media users hinted that the healthy calf could have died after it
was tied on the neck with a rope and dragged.

The video footage that is circulating on social media now strengthens this
view.

The mental shock of getting separated from the herd and the wrong approach
of the untrained forest officers might have scared the calf, they claimed.

The calf was first spotted near the lookout point at Moozhiyar-Kakki road
on last Wednesday morning. It had injury marks on its right leg and face.

Though forest officials reached the spot, the calf withdrew into the forest
by afternoon. Since then, the calf was seen several times on the
Moozhiyar-Kakki road. It tried to scare away people and motorists.

After this, the calf was spotted in a weak condition at Aranamudi near
Kakki on Monday evening after a search conducted by the forest department
officials from Kochukoyikkal and Pachakanam stations.

It died while it was being treated in the presence of Konni forest
veterinary surgeon Dr Jayakumar in a hall next to the Goodrikkal range
office on Monday night.

Since there was water in its lungs, the calf was not in a position to
consume milk.

Officials admitted that though they tried to provide warmth and drip, the
calf could not be saved. Since it got separated from the herd, the female
calf that was about a year old was in a bad condition.

Lack of milk resulted in loss of immunity, said Dr Jayakumar.

The forest officials believe that had it been provided treatment at the
right time, the calf could have been saved as it was in good health when it
was first spotted.

They now regret the decision to leave it back to the forest as the herd
generally doesn't take back those that are separated.

Even then, the decision to capture the calf and take it to Konni was taken
days later. By then its health had deteriorated further. The carcass was
buried after postmortem.

KOTA KINABALU: An elephant was found dead at an oil palm plantation in Ulu
Segama, Lahad Datu, Eastern Sabah on Monday (July 16).

Sabah Wildlife Department public relation officer Siti Nur'Ain Ampuan Acheh
said the male juvenile pachyderm was discovered by plantation workers at
about 5.10pm Monday.

She said a team of rangers from the Lahad Datu Wildlife Office was
immediately sent to check on the information.

""Upon inspection, the team found that the elephant had an injured foot,
believed due to a snare trap,"" she said in a statement on Tuesday (July 17).

At least eight elephants have been reported dead due to various reasons in
Sabah between April and July this year. The deaths were reported in the
state's east coast and Lok Kawi Wildlife Park.

As oil palm plantations expand into former forest habitats of elephants,
human-elephant conflicts have become an issue in Sabah.

Elephants are seen as pests by plantation operators as they eat the oil
palm fruits.

Various methods, including electric fences and outright shooting, have been
reported to keep the animals away.

There is the long-standing issue of poaching elephants for the illegal
ivory market.

Elephants are also often caught in snares meant for other animals such as
wild boar and end up dying a slow, painful death from infected wounds.

Sabah Chief Minister Shafie Apdal has announced a greater priority on
wildlife conservation in the state.

Police have launched manhunt operations against poachers who killed one
wild elephant in Par Paw village in Singu township in Mandalay Region.

The elephant, estimated to be 40 years old, was killed on Saturday
according to villagers, U Tint Swe, director of the Mandalay Region
Department of Forestry told The Myanmar Timeson Monday.

“The elephant was killed by a poisoned arrow fired from a percussion rifle.
As the site is near a residential area, tusk and skin were not removed and
taken from the dead elephant. We are investigating the incident in
cooperation with the police,” U Tint Swe said.

“In March, one wild elephant was also killed in nearby Thabeikkyin
township. Elephant killings are quite frequent in our areas. There are some
preventive measures that have been initiated but killings,” an official of
Singu township Department of Forestry, who requested anonymity, said.

Combined teams of police and Department of Forestry officials have been
dispatched to hunt down the suspects and a case was opened under section 41
(a) of the Biodiversity and Protected Areas Law at Letpanhla police station
by the forest department.

“As the areas in Thabeikkyin and Singu are surrounded by forests, many wild
elephants dwell there. So there are also many poachers. With the help of
the police, these poachers could be arrested if they can be pursued deep
into the jungle,” a resident from Letpanhla village U Thaung Tun said.

The Department of Forestry said seven wild elephants have been killed in

A villager in a remote settlement shot and killed an endangered pygmy
elephant on Borneo island after it destroyed palm oil trees.

Local wildlife officials are now investigating the elephant’s death after
the body was found on the side of a road Monday on the Malaysian part of
Borneo, a local wildlife department director Augustine Tuuga told the AFP.

“(The elephant) was killed out of revenge for destroying crops,” Tuuga said.

An autopsy of the body determined that its cause of death was from a bullet
hole in the right side of its abdomen.

""The wound was traced and it led to the finding of a bullet pellet inside
the abdomen,"" wildlife officials from Sabah Wildlife Department said in a
statement.

""Some parts of the intestines were torn. There was a severe internal
bleeding inside the abdomen suggesting several blood vessels were damaged,""
public relations officer Siti Nur’Ain Ampuan Acheh told The Star newspaper.

The wildlife official, Tuuga, called the killing ""merciless.""

Pygmy elephants are baby-faced with huge ears, plump bellies and long tails
that often drag on the ground. There are only an estimated 1,500 left in
the wild, according to environmental group the World Wide Fund for Nature
(WWF).

They roam the rainforest in Borneo, the world's third-largest island, which
is shared between Malaysia, Indonesia and Brunei.

There, these animals sometimes fall victim to poachers looking to harvest
the animal’s tusks to sell on the black market. But the creature that was
found dead on Monday had tusks that remained intact.

This is just one of many rare species one in the Malaysian rainforests that
have fallen dramatically in recent decades, according to the AFP.

Many species struggle to survive because of agriculture and settlements
encroaching on habitats. Poachers also hunt the animals for their body
parts that are often used in traditional Chinese medicine.

In May, six Borneo pygmy elephants were found dead in Malaysian palm oil
plantations. Wildlife officials thought that the animals might have
accidently consumed fertilizer. No wounds were found on their bodies, so
these animals might have been drinking from poisonous watering holes, The
Star newspaper reported at the time.

At least 18 pygmy elephants have been found dead in Malaysian Borneo since
April. Most of the animals were killed by poachers or from poisoning.

found with injuries on it’s right foot believed after stepping into the
poacher’s trap.

Augustine said the elephant was believed to be left behind due to it’s
condition.

“The wounds are getting worst as the trap getting tighter while they are
moving,” he said, when met while accompanying the State Assistant Minister
of Tourism, Culture and Environment, Assafal P Alian to Kawag Tourism
Centre.

RUDRAPUR: An elephant was electrocuted by a high-power electric line early
on Saturday in the central forest range of Terai division in Pantnagar.

The pachyderm was electrocuted and fell into a pond under the purview of
the fisheries department of GB Pant University.

This is the sixth death of an elephant in the past 15 months in this forest
range.

The carcass was spotted in the morning by local residents and forest
officials were informed.

Forest ranger Harish Ram Arya said, “Prima facie it appears that the
electric line was active and running low which resulted in the pachyderm
accidentally touching it. People said that they heard wails of the animal
sometime at 2 am followed by a power blackout.”

Local residents said that they have witnessed regular elephant activity in
the area but no protective measures have been taken by the forest
department.

ANGUL/DHENKANAL: A 10-year-old male elephant was electrocuted in Teltaila
village under Mandargiri reserve forest of Angul forest range on Thursday
night while a 40-year-old injured tusker in Dhenkanal has not been
responding to treatment.

At Teltaila, some villagers spotted the carcass of the elephant near the
village and informed forest officials.

DFO V Karthik said the elephant appeared to have died after coming in
contact with a live wire. Investigation is on to find out who laid the live
wire and postmortem report of the animal is awaited, he added.

In Dhenkanal, the tusker that had sustained injuries last month is not
responding to treatment for the last 15 days.

The tusker has sustained deep injury marks on its body and stayed put in
Kankili forest under Parjang block. Forest officials are unable to go near
the animal as it has been turning violent.

Forest officials said the elephant was injured during infighting in its
herd, but locals alleged that it was attacked by poachers. A team of
experts, led by veterinarian Indramani Nath, examined the tusker on July 29
and suggested for continuation of oral medications, but it has not been
responding to the medicines.

Death of three elephants - two females and a tusker - within a
fortnight in Angul district has raised concern among wildlife lovers.
A female elephant and tusker were electrocuted at different places
while another female elephant was found dead under mysterious
circumstances, according to the Forest department.On August 10, a
female elephant came in contact with a live wire at Tilatalia village
under Mandargiri reserve forest of Angul division. On August 17,
another female elephant was found dead near Majhipara village under
Tikarpara forest range of Satkosia Wildlife Division. The cause of
death has not been ascertained and postmortem report is awaited,
forest officials said.

On Monday morning, there was one more casualty when a 15-year-old
tusker was electrocuted in an orchard near Pokhtunga village under
Bantala range of Angul forest division. Angul DFO V Karthik said a
week back, a herd of elephants had entered the orchard of one Amulya
Pradhan and he may have laid live wire to keep the animals away.
Pradhan was arrested and forwarded to court on Tuesday. In connection
with the Tilataila electrocution, five persons have been arrested, the
DFO said.

The official stated that lack of awareness has led people to resort to
illegal methods like laying live wires to keep elephants from their
farmlands or human settlements. Some also do put up the wires to catch
boars. The Forest department has initiated various measures to deal
with the menace. “The department has opened a toll free number for
people to report elephant-related cases and cabling of live wires is
being undertaken in the forest division”, Karthik said.

TURA: There seem to be no end in sight to the raging man and animal
conflict with yet another prized elephant losing its life to human
development in the Garo Hills region.

An adult male elephant moving through  Baghmara reserve forest was
electrocuted early Saturday morning after coming in contact with a powerful
11 Kilo Watt transmission line that was passing through the reserve area.

The solitary male pachyderm came in contact with the power line passing
through the forests, at around 3:30 AM, at a place called Bhawanipur, 6 kms
from Baghmara, on the road towards Rongara. The electric power transmission
line passing through the forest region gives electricity to the Rangasora
village area.

Preliminary investigation indicates that the elephant, which reportedly had
cuts and sores in some parts of its body, may have tried to scratch itself
to a fallen tree that had touched the power line.

This is not the first time animals, especially elephants, have died from
human activities along its route. Vast stretches of the reserve forests in
Baghmara and Rongara are home to dozens of herds of pachyderms that
crisscross to and fro Baghmara forests and into the plains of neighbouring
Bangladesh.

Several elephant tragedies have occurred in the recent past, a majority of
deaths occurring from electrocution.

Sunday, August 12, was World Elephant Day. The world celebrated the
pachyderms while India worried over the animals’ survival.

Out of the 88 identified elephant corridors in India, 21 have railway
tracks running through them. The knowledge of these corridors is passed on
between elephants from generations to generations, thus walking through
these corridors is a natural instinct for them.

As the resources in their fragmented pockets become scarcer, these
elephants are pushed to cross railway tracks in search for food often to
meet their fatal end. It comes as no surprise then that since 1987 to July
2017, 266 elephants lost their lives.

Between January and June this year, at least 15 elephants were killed,
maintained Wildlife SOS, which has been running an Elephant Conservation
and Care Center (ECCC) since 2010.

Kartick Satyanarayan, Co-founder and CEO of Wildlife SOS, said “It is now
normal to open a newspaper and read horrifying news of elephants dying due
to unnatural, anthropogenic reasons. This normalisation of unnatural deaths
of elephants in India is alarming. The survival of Asian elephants today
lies in the hands of us—conservationists, policy-makers, practitioners and
local communities.”

Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) are listed as ‘endangered’ by the
International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and protected under
Schedule I of the Indian Wildlife Protection Act, 1972.

“The population of Asian elephants has decreased by 90 per cent over the
last century and with a population of 23,000 to 27,000 Asian elephants,
India is the last stronghold of the species. The survival of the species is
critically linked with its survival in India,” said Geeta Seshamani,
Co-founder and Secretary of Wildlife SOS.

Among the major threats to the survival of elephants in India are poaching
for captivity and human-elephant conflict. People for Ethical Treatment of
Animals (PETA) India has been demanding a ban on elephant joy rides at the
iconic Amer Fort in Jaipur. Recently, PETA activists in Mysore wore masks,
chains and shackles to request authorities to ban the use of elephants for
performances.

Another major crisis is the human–elephant conflict. As forests are being
destroyed to create agricultural lands, incidents of crop-raiding,
destruction of property and loss of human lives have escalated. According
to the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, about 489 human
deaths caused by elephants were reported in India during the year 2017-18.
Of this, 22 were reported from Karnataka.

However, experts feel such conflicts are avoidable. With scientific
wildlife tracking techniques and community engagement and sensitization, a
safe space for both farmers and elephants can be created.

Elephant Carcass Found in Bandipur Tiger Reserve

An elephant was found dead in Doddbargi section under Bandipur Tiger
Reserve on Sunday. Speaking to BM, Head Of Forest Force, PCCF, Punati
Sridhar said, “The elephant died due to illegal electrocution. We can’t
just say poachers have done this as farmers too use electric fences to
protect their crops from wild animals. The elephant might have been
electrocuted by going near the fence and we are looking for the culprits
responsible for this. Animal poaching has also increased and the carcass of
a tiger was found recently. It had died due to electrocution by the
poachers. We are forming a special team from forest department to search
for clues. Hopefully, culprits will be arrested soon. We are taking
precautionary measures to control the death of wild animals”.

HD Kote Police Station registered a case under Wildlife Protection Act.

KOTA KINABALU: Deputy Chief Minister Christina Liew is deeply disturbed by
the rising number of elephants dying in the wild in Sabah.

Liew, who is also tourism, culture and environment minister, has asked the
state Wildlife Department, which is under her purview, to take extra
measures to curb such deaths.

“I’d like to push the Wildlife Department to minimise these unfortunate
deaths,” she said on the sidelines of the state assembly sitting today.

“Members of the public find it very distressing to see these animals dying.

“We’re doing our best. We’ll be transparent so the public will know.”

Liew said the latest death was that of a baby elephant. Its carcass was
found in a river in Kinabatangan, on Sabah’s east coast, yesterday.

State Wildlife Department director Augustine Tuuga said a tourist boat
stumbled upon the baby elephant, believed to be about two years old in
Sukau, Kinabatangan.

“The team secured the elephant carcass to the river bank and we’ll send a
vet to conduct the post-mortem to determine the cause of death. Preliminary
findings show there were no injuries on the elephant’s body.

“Another report we received yesterday was the discovery of a male elephant
with injuries to its front leg, due to snare traps, near Taliwas, a
recreational area in Lahad Datu,” he said.

A rescue team, including veterinarians, were sent this morning to secure
and treat the wounded animal, he added.

There have been several reported deaths of elephants in recent months. A
young male Borneo pygmy elephant, believed to have been shot dead, was
found in Tongod, a district in the heart of Sabah, in July.

The same month, another elephant was found dead in an oil palm plantation
in Ulu Segama, Lahad Datu. The elephant died due to a wound infection in
its foot, caused by a snare trap.

TELUPID: The Sabah Wildlife Department (SWD) is offering a reward of
RM120,000 for any information that would lead to the arrests of poachers or
people setting up snare traps in the state.

The offer was announced following the shocking deaths of 25 Borneo pygmy
elephants in the first eight months of this year, with 24 of them dying in
the last four months.

The causes of death ranged from gunshot injuries, to wounds incurred from
traps set up by hunters and other unknown causes.

Elephants injured by trapping devices will develop infections before they
die.

WWF Malaysia said that snares are commonly used by poachers, where they are
placed along animal trails in forest reserves bordering plantations with
the intention of catching wild boars and deer.

Though elephants are very rarely the target of poachers, they commonly fall
victim to these devices as they use the same trails as other wildlife.

SWD director Augustine Tuuga said it was not easy to detect the culprits as
no witnesses have come forward so far to give information despite the
RM120,000 reward offer.

This is not the first time the department has offered cash rewards for
information leading to the arrest of the culprits. It had previously made a
similar offer following the deaths of 14 elephants in the Gunung Rara
Forest Reserve in 2013.

According to Tuuga, that case is still open.

""We also offered RM20,000 reward for information on the killing of the
elephant with sabre tusks (in 2017) but nobody came forward.

""Don’t know, maybe they really do not have any information,"" Tuuga said,
when asked why no one had come forward.

In the latest case, a female elephant was found dead at Ladang Bintang Emas
Property Sdn Bhd in Tongod here on Saturday (Aug 25).

The cow, aged between 12 and 15, was believed to have been shot dead about
a week before its discovery.

SWD public relations officer Siti Nur'ain Ampuan Acheh said the case was
reported to the department by the Tongod District Forest Officer.

""SWD despatched a team of rangers and veterinary officer to investigate and
conduct a post-mortem on the animal on Monday (Aug 27).

""The carcass was mildly decomposing. It was estimated that it had died
about a week earlier,"" she said.

Siti Nur'ain said a round-shaped penetrating wound was found near the
elephant's temple.

""No bullet was found on the body. The death of the elephant is probably due
to neurological damages caused to the brain,"" she said.

The cow was among four elephants found dead over the weekend in Sabah's
east coast. Another elephant was found trapped in a snare trap and suffered
injuries.

Locals say Nadodi Ganesan’s leg got stuck when it was being chased into
forest
For over 50 years, Nadodi Ganesan co-existed peacefully among the hundreds
of human settlements in the O-Valley and Bitherkad forest ranges of Gudalur
and Pandalur. On Friday, the elephant’s luck finally ran out.

The makhna or tusk-less elephant, known for becoming so acclimatised to
living near humans that locals even fed it, died after getting stuck in a
sewage pit in Kurinji Nagar in the O-Valley Forest Range.

Forest Department officials said that the elephant, believed to be among
the oldest in the region, aged between 50 and 55 years, had entered the
settlement late on Thursday.

Locals said that the animal was being chased back into the forest to
prevent it from damaging houses and crops when one of its front legs got
stuck in the sewage pit.

V.C. Rahul, District Forest Officer (Gudalur Division), said that when
forest staff arrived, the animal had a faint pulse, and by the time efforts
were mounted to try and rescue the animal using an earth mover, it had died
from its injuries.

David Mohan, a veterinarian from the Animal Husbandry Department, performed
an autopsy on the animal. Forest department officials confirmed that the
elephant died from an injury to the chest.

Forest staff, locals and conservationists who have worked with the elephant
and lived alongside it voiced their sadness. C. Manoharan, Forest Range
Officer, Bitherkad Range, who was part of the effort to treat Nadodi
Ganesan a few months ago when it got injured, said that there was a great
feeling of loss among local staff who had grown attached to the animal.

“We were tracking its movements a few months ago, when the animal moved
away from its home range in Bitherkad and went to O-Valley. We expected
Nadodi Ganesan to return later this year and were preparing to endure some
sleepless nights to try and chase him away from entering farmlands in the
area,” he added.

‘Biggest’ in the region

Tarsh Thekaekara, a conservationist from the Shola Trust, said that Nadodi
Ganesan had become synonymous with the landscape. “Even now, if you look
for pictures of human-animal conflict in Gudalur online, chances are that
you will stumble upon a photo of Nadodi Ganesan. Almost everyone in the
region knows him, as he is also the biggest elephant in the landscape,
standing at just over 10 feet,” said Mr. Thekaekara.

Forest department staff buried the carcass of the animal after completion
of the autopsy.

TAMULPUR: The carcass of a wild elephant was recovered on Tuesday morning
at No 2 Kalipur village along the Indo-Bhutan border under Tamulpur
subdivision in the district of Baksa.

A large herd of wild elephants has been moving from village to village
along the Indo-Bhutan border in search of food since last 15-16 years.

According to the report, on Monday night a herd of wild elephant entered No
2 Kalipur village in search of food. On Tuesday morning, local people found
a female wild elephant lying dead near a paddy field along the River
Matanga of village No 2 Kalipur.

When the news spread in the village, a large number of people gathered at
the spot where the wild elephant was found dead. Getting the information,
forest officials also arrived and recovered the carcass of the wild
elephant.

Till the filing of this report, the actual cause of death of the wild
elephant had not been ascertained.

But forest officials told media persons that some villagers hang electric
wires connected with inverter around their paddy fields to protect their
crops and it is suspected that due to electric shock the wild elephant
might have died.

After post-mortem, the wild elephant was buried with the help of local
people.

The menace of wild elephants is a burning problem in Tamulpur subdivision
as well as in Baksa district.

More than 80 people have been killed by wild elephants and nine wild
elephants died due to human-wild elephant conflict in Tamulpur subdivision
in the last 15 years. Local people have been demanding scientific measures
to control the wild elephants and to protect the lives and properties of
local people as well as to protect the wild elephants also.

A 35-year-old tusker was found dead in Amangarh Tiger Reserve (ATR) area on
Wednesday morning.

The body of the tusker was found near Meerapur Maloni village located on
UP-Uttrakhand border in Amangarh Tiger Reserve. It was around 100 meters
inside UP.

According to officials, the dead tusker had few injury marks on its body.
Hence, it is being considered that the elephant might have been hunted by
poachers.

However, the forest officials said that the cause of the death will be
determined only after the post-mortem report is out. A team of Indian
Veterinary Research Institute from Bareilly will come here to carry out
autopsy of the dead elephant on Thursday. The incident came to the fore
when the villagers spotted the body lying on the ground in the forest area.

They then informed the forest officials and rushed to the spot. There are
some injuries on the neck and stomach of the tusker. Divisional forest
officer M Semmaran, however, confirmed that the dead elephant was injured
on its neck.

“The reason of the death is not clear so far. The IVRI team will conduct
post-mortem of the body, and we will be able to say something only after
the autopsy. The post-morterm will be carried out on Thursday,” he said.

KOTA KINABALU: Sabah recorded its 26th elephant death for this year as a
juvenile male succumbed to snare trap injuries while undergoing treatment
at Borneon Elephant Sanctuary in Kinabatangan this morning.

State Wildlife Department spokesman Siti Nur’ain Ampuan Acheh said the
juvenile male elephant, aged about 5, was rescued at Ulu Segama Forest
Reserve in Lahad Datu on Tuesday.

“A team consisted of a veterinarian and wildlife rangers was dispatched to
the location to rescue the injured elephant.

“They managed to capture the elephant and initiated treatment,” she said in
a statement, adding the elephant was weak and had suffered a severe and
deep wound which already reached the bone of left front leg.

She added further treatment was supposed to be done at the sanctuary but it
did not respond well to the treatment and died at 8.40am this morning.

“Post mortem was conducted to determine the cause of death.

“Findings revealed that the elephant died due to septicemia which
originated from the severe snare trap injury.”

On Thursday, Sabah Chief Minister Datuk Seri Mohd Shafie Apdal had ordered
the state Tourism, Culture, Environment Minister Christina Liew and
Agriculture and Food Industry Junz Wong to hold special meetings with
plantation owners on the issue.

The initiative is to engage plantation workers to help with the fight
against poaching and killing in their areas.

Liew had said a special unit will be formed when experts from the United
States arrive to address elephants poaching and killing issues in Sabah.

A female elephant was electrocuted after coming in contact with livewires
set up at a riverine island near Borgang river of Assam’s Biswanath
district, around 1 km from the sixth addition of Kaziranga National Park.

According to forest officials, the ‘deliberate’ case of electrocution also
led to the death of a mature foetus the young female was carrying.

“It’s a deliberate case of electrocution where the solar fence was powered
from the AC main line instead of going through a battery powered
energizer,” said P Sivakumar, conservator of forests, northern Assam
circle, Tezpur.

Wildlife conservationist Kaushik Barua said, “It seems from the last few
incidents that a large number of young adult elephants are being killed.
These were elephants which would have bred – an entire generation of
elephants are being lost due to such ghastly acts by humans.”

Meanwhile, the forest department has lodged a complaint against the
villager of Kathonibari area who allegedly laid the 220-Volt livewires
leading to the death of the pregnant elephant.

A post mortem report is awaited.

Locals said that a herd of 50-60 elephants have wandered into the area in
search of food. The forest department had already taken measures to secure
crop fields from marauding elephants.

Electrocution deaths can be both accidental and deliberate.

Wildlife conservationist Kaushik Barua believes that rather than
restricting the installation and use of power fences, a mechanism should be
in place that doesn’t pose a threat to elephants.

“Proper equipment and permissible source of power needs to be ensured,”
said Barua.

In another incident last week, an abandoned elephant calf was rescued by
forest officials in the same area.

An elephant was found dead, believed to have been electrocuted from an
illegally-drawn wire, at Vadderahalli on the southern outskirts of the city
on Friday morning.

Forest officials said the tusker-less male elephant, aged about 40-45
years, was found barely 150m from the border of the Bannerghatta National
Park.

“The area commonly sees elephant movements in the past, and crop loss
compensation is the highest here. After grazing in the farmlands nearby on
Thursday night, it was returning to the forests when it came in contact
with the live wire placed on the floor,” said Varun Kumar, Range Forest
Officer (Kaggalipura).

The officer says the owner of the land, Prabhu Kumar, and his family had
drawn the wire from an electric pole to keep away wild boars which were
causing crop loss.

However, the pachyderm came in contact with this and died on the spot. “The
accused have cleared the wires, and have fled. We have registered a case
under the Wildlife Act,” said Mr. Varun Kumar.

The area is a critical corridor which connects Bannerghatta National Park
and the hillocks of Savandurga.

The traditional elephant corridor, which is also seeing rapid urbanisation,
has become a theatre of man-elephant conflict, which flared in 2016-end
when Sidda, a tusker, battled for life for nearly 40 days after being shot
at by villagers.

BANGKOK: A young male elephant was electrocuted in Thailand after stumbling
into a drain and crashing into a restaurant sign, police said Saturday (Sep
15).

Two elephant handlers were walking 10-year-old Plai Nam Choke - or ""Lucky""
in English - around a town in Samut Prakhan province south of Bangkok,
offering passers-by the chance to feed him for cash.

But Lucky stumbled into an open sewer and collided with an electric
signboard outside a restaurant, said police officer Nopporn Saengsawang.

""I received a call at 8.30 pm that the elephant was stuck in the drain,"" he
said. ""He likely died from electrocution.""

Some rescue workers from a local charity group attempted CPR on Lucky for
three hours after he fell.

The two handlers were charged with illegally moving the elephant and animal
cruelty offences, Nopporn said.

Lucky hailed from the northeastern province of Surin, home to a famous
annual elephant fair that features a parade by performing pachyderms.

Wild elephants can still be seen in Thailand's national forests, but their
numbers have dwindled to about 2,700 from a peak of over 100,000 in 1850.

A large number have been domesticated for entertainment or tourism
purposes, prompting accusations of animal cruelty.

Handlers are usually banned from walking elephants through cities due to
space constraints, but many risk punishment in pursuit of living.

Research has shown that elephants caught in the wild and subjected to a
lifetime of captivity suffer from long-term stress and tend to have shorter
lifespans.

One of the largest elephants in Kala Wewa National Park, also the leader of
a herd, has been killed after being attacked by a tusker.

Camera footage had caught nearly 300 elephants were seen paying their last
respect to the leader yesterday (16).

The deceased elephant had reportedly engaged in a conflict with a tusker
roaming around Kala Wewa, for several days, according to the Wildlife
Officers.

After being critically attacked by the tusker, the leader of the herd had
died yesterday.

Nearly two herds of elephants, including elephant calves, had arrived at
the location, to grieve the dead herd leader.

Wildlife Officers stated that the elephants of a herd take protective
measures to protect their leader when they sense an imminent danger, and
such incidents are a rare sight to be witnessed.

The tusker which killed the leader of the elephant herd had returned to
attack the deceased elephant once the rest of the elephants had left the
area, said Wildlife Officers.

Meanwhile, an elephant calf, believed to be nearly 5-years-old, has died

A baby elephant was electrocuted at Artham village of Komarada mandal on
Sunday morning.

The three-year-old elephant had reportedly tried to damage the transformer,
according to officials of the Forest Department.

The officials asked the villagers of various mandals, including Komarada,
Jiyammavalasa, Garugubilli and others, to be cautious for the next few days
as herd of elephants might vent their ire with the death of baby elephant.

Meanwhile, Minister for Mines and Geology Sujay Krishna Ranga Rao said that
20 trackers were following elephants constantly.

He urged people not to provoke wild animals and inform the nearby revenue
and police officials if they were in the vicinity of their respective
residential areas.

RISHIKESH: Suspected poachers allegedly killed a male elephant in the
Shivalik forests of Uttarakhand and made away with its twin tusks,
officials said Monday.

Acting District Forest Officer Dharma Singh Meena said the 45-year-old
tusker's body, which does not bear any external injury mark, is being sent
for a post-mortem to ascertain how it was killed.

However, the removal of its tusks makes it look like a case of illegal
poaching, the DFO said.

It appears poachers killed the tusker not far from the forest checkpost in
the Thano range of Dehradun forest division late Sunday evening and made
away with its twin tusks, he said.

Forest and Special Task Force personnel have stepped up vigilance in the
wake of the incident, he said.

KOLABIRA: Despite treatment for the last three days, a terminally ill
elephant died at Malatitikra under Kolabira forest range in Jharsuguda
Wednesday.

A team comprising divisional forest officer Sushant Kumar, assistant
conservator of forest Saroj Panda and veterinary officer Dr Salini Sethy
conducted some tests before confirming the elephant’s death.

The carcass was buried after post-mortem.

According to local residents, one of the legs of the elephant, aged 50, was
short due to polio.

This deformity along with sickness restricted its movement to a great
extent. It also stopped taking food.

Three days ago, it got stuck in the mud at a paddy field on the side of
Chandanimal river while coming out of Mahulamunda forest.

The forest officials after trying several methods succeeded in getting the
elephant out of the swamp Sunday. But the effort made the elephant weak and

In what seems like a case of retribution, an elephant captured by the
forest department authorities from Sidhi district, Madhya Pradesh, was
killed by poisoning while in captivity on Sunday.

The case also exposes poor protection measures of the forest department
staff in the state.

A dead cow and a dead dog were also found in the vicinity.

Sources in the forest department said that five elephants that had entered
Madhya Pradesh from Chhattisgarh were captured between September 9 and 16.
The elephants had been raiding crops, destroying homes and had killed one
person after which they were captured.

After being captured in Sidhi district, the elephants were chained and kept
in a forest near Chapondi village.

It was decided that the elephants would be taken to Bandhavgarh National
Park where they would be trained and used for patrolling.

The authorities later began transporting elephants on truck one at a time.
On Saturday, the fourth elephant was taken to Bandhavgarh. However, when
the truck scheduled to take the fifth elephant arrived at the camp, the
Sidhi forest division found out that the elephant was dead.

The security of the elephants had been entrusted to forest department staff
that were to stay at the elephant camp to protect them. A post-mortem was
conducted on the dead elephant which confirmed death due to poisoning.

Sources in the forest department added that the villagers, who lost their
crops, could be responsible for all this.

A cow and a dog were also found dead at the spot, suggesting that they too
ate the poisoned food offered to the elephant.

The matter is being investigated and a case of poaching has been
registered.

RAIPUR: Duplicity of human nature knows no bound as while they worshipped
the elephant-headed god on one side and cruelly killed a real, living,
breathing elephant calf on another in Sidhi district of Madhya Pradesh on
Sunday night.

Claims and counter claims flying thick and fast as beleaguered MP Forest
Department accusing unidentified people for poisoning while the wildlife
conservationists alleging the MP Forest staff of killing the elephant calf
by overdosing of tranquiliser anaesthetics.

After entering in the Sidhi district of MP from Chhattisgarh, a herd of
five elephants arrived at village Kundor of Kusmi Tehsil in August and
began raiding the farmlands and granaries two or three days later.

Elephants have reportedly caused most damage in villages of Kundor, Podi,
Karaunti, Aamgaon, Medhki, Jhapri, Shankarpur, Parasi, Charki, Mata,
Nodhiya etc. It sparked a series of protests by the villagers.

MP Forest Department came under tremendous pressure as the MP villagers
went as far as issuing death threats to the forest field staff.

Under-pressure officials of Sanjay Tiger Reserve sent a proposal for
capturing the jumbos, which was approved by MP Principal Chief Conservator
of Forest (PCCF) Sahbaz Ahmed and directed for keeping the animals in
Bandhavgarh Tiger Reserve.

While the capturing may be justified due to public pressure, the
unprofessional way  with which the sensitive animals were caught can’t by
any sane means.

One of the captured elephants was found to have been shot by muzzle guns as
veterinarians discovered ball-bearings used as ammunition in crude muzzle
guns in his body. Luckily, he still survived.

The tranquilised elephants were kept at Ghoghi camp, where the calf died.
It is crucial to note here that young elephant had fallen ill the day he
was captured by tranquilising.

Just as the Forest Department was preparing to transfer elephants to
Bandhavgarh Tiger Reserve, calf succumbed.

Fate of four other elephants has now been sealed in the box of captivity as
MP Forest officials have decided to train them, most likely for commercial
purpose, in Bandhavgarh instead of releasing back in the forests. Once wild
and free, the elephants will soon be used to ferry tourists or roll the
wooden logs.

Replying in a rather causal way, MP PCCF Sahbaz Ahmed told that elephants
will now be trained by mahouts. One elephant has been shot; no case has
been registered yet. Also, elephant calf has died of poisoning by
unidentified people and not due to tranquiliser overdose.”

A 15-month-old elephant named Amirah died four months after she severely
injured her leg in a wire trap, despite receiving routine medical treatment.

She died of an internal organ complication caused by severe distress and
acute dehydration. She had been receiving treatment at the Elephant
Training Center in Saree, Aceh Besar, Aceh.

Amirah, also called Mey, was found injured in Geumpang, Pidie regency on
May 3 this year. Amira was left behind by her herd and the Aceh Natural
Resources Conservation Agency (Aceh BKSDA) took her to the center and
treated her wounded leg, which was almost completely torn off.

Agency head Sapto Aji Prabowo said on Monday that Amirah's wound did not
cause her death, which had healed completely. He suspected she died because
her liver and kidney was not functioning well.

“Amira’s health had been in poor condition since we brought her here. She
suffered from stress and malnutrition,” Sapto said.

Amira had received medical treatment from a joint team comprising Aceh
BKSDA and the Syiah Kuala University’s Medical School for four months.

Veterinarian Rosa Rika Wahyuni, who had been taking care of Amirah, said
she suffered from stress because she was separated from her mother and
herd, which worsened her health. The stress made Amirah vulnerable to
diarrhea and other diseases.

“We tried hard, but it was not enough to save the elephant,” said Rosa.

DHENKANAL: Acting on a tip-off, Forest Department personnel recovered the
carcass of a female elephant from a forest near Mahajan Taila village under
Mahabirod forest range in Dhenkanal forest division Tuesday morning.

Preliminary probe revealed the pachyderm was shot dead by unidentified
poachers. The animal bore two bullet injuries – one near its right eye and
another on the right side of its stomach.

According to villagers, a herd comprising over 15 elephants currently
inhabits the Mahabirod forest and it often strays into the village during
nights and cause havoc.

The pachyderms feed on standing paddy crop and destroy vegetables. Earlier,
the villagers had informed the Forest Department officials about the
presence of the jumbos, but no steps were taken to drive the marauding
animals.

Repeated attacks by the elephants also made the local villagers suffer
losses as several acres of farmlands were damaged. Similarly, the
pachyderms also vandalised many houses.

While no exact reason of the killing has been ascertained yet, rumours are
doing the round that the animal might have been killed by some villagers to
vent their anger over the losses caused by the herd. On the other hand,
some suspected it was the act of some poachers.

On being informed, Mahabirod Ranger Suresh Chandra Behera and Dadaraghati
Forester Ramchandra Rout along with other Forest Department officials
reached the spot and started an investigation into the pachyderm’s death.

The officials conducted the autopsy of the carcass and buried it in the
forest. When contacted, Ranger Behera said that a probe was on and those
behind the heinous act would be arrested soon and action would be taken as
per law.

On the other hand, villagers held the negligent attitude of the Forest
Department officials responsible for the death of the pachyderm.

“Had the Forest Department officials been vigilant regarding the movement
of the herd and taken necessary steps to drive the herd into the forest,
the pachyderm would have been alive now,” a local farmer said.",1

spot to take a look at the baby elephant’s carcass. A lot of villagers shed
tears over the tusker’s death and few paid floral tributes.

The local people informed the personnel posted at Nagrijuli Police Outpost
and the Forest Department authorities about the elephant carcass.

Nikhil Singha, In-charge of the outpost came to the spot with a police
team. A team of Forest Department officials also rushed to the spot and
started investigations to find out the exact cause behind the death of the
elephant calf (wild). But, the Forest Department personnel could not
ascertain the exact cause behind the baby elephant’s death.

Later, a veterinary doctor was called in to conduct postmortem following
which the carcass of the calf was buried on the spot with the help of the
villagers.

The villagers stated that a herd of wild elephants were seen moving in the
Nagrijuli area few days back. It is reported that on Wednesday night, a
herd of wild elephants had entered No 1 Bagrikhuti Village and had
“feasted” on a huge stretch of paddy fields and destroyed the same.

It is suspected that the elephant calf might have entered the said village
with the herd and might have been killed by irate villagers.

It may be mentioned that man-elephant conflict is taking alarming
proportions in Assam. With the human population rising by the day and
people settling on elephant corridors, the tuskers are being compelled to
come out in the open in search of food and, in the process, destroying
human hutments and paddy fields.

Jhargram district.

The wild elephant was spotted dead in a paddy field at Kanthi village under
Nayagrampolice station of Jhargram by a farmer today morning. He alerted
the villagers, who, in turn, informed the forest department.

A team from Nayagram forest beat office came and took away the carcass in a
lorry. There are no visible injury marks on the body of the dead elephant
and hence, foresters are not sure what led to its death.

“We are performing a post-mortem of the carcass. Hope this will reveal the
cause of death,” Arup Mukherjee, the divisional forest officer of
Kharagpur, said.

A section of forest officers, however, is already suspecting that the wild
elephant has died either of electric shock or by gulping pesticide kept by
the paddy field.

To keep wild elephant at bay, farmers often install unauthorised
high-voltage power cable around paddy filed or plant food laced with deadly
pesticide.",1

Once, the Athagarh forest was rich wildlife hub with elephants, tigers,
boars, bears, rabbits, deer, sambars and many other animals and birds
living.

But due to no-holds-barred cutting of trees in the jungle and animal
poaching by mafias in connivance with the forest officials, Athagarh
forests have turned unsafe for the wildlife.

Lack of food and adequate drinking water in the jungle has forced the wild
animals to stray into the human habitations, taking the farm crops as their
food, triggering man-animal conflicts. The rare animals like tigers
sometimes caught in CCTV cameras in Narsinghpur forest range areas have
gone extinct.

Similarly, the jungle once provided a congenial atmosphere for the
elephants which were seen in large numbers at least a decade ago. But for
the present precarious conditions of the jungle, the number of elephants is
fast decreasing.

Only in the last five years, the Athagarh forest division has witnessed the
death of 50 elephants as per official data but the private sources say over
60 have perished due to poaching for various reasons like collecting tusks,
disease, killing by farmers for destructing their crops, falling in ditches
and water reservoirs and infighting etc.

This week, the department has seized the carcasses of three elephants from
Athagarh forest range areas. As per the data available with Athagarh Forest
Division office in 2013-14, at least 11 elephants died. In 2014-15 its
number, however, fell at 3. In 2015-16 at least 10 elephants died and in
2016-17 the number rose to 12. In 2017-18 till September end, 14 elephants
perished.

Though the Forest department has spent crores of rupees for protecting the
wild lives in Athagarh jungle by employing hundreds of forest forces,
including DFO, ACF, Range Officers, Foresters, Forest Guards, elephant
watchers and trackers, besides para forest staff along with other
Government officials and Vana Surakshya Samiti members, and has undertaken
several projects like solar fencing, digging of water bodies in the jungle
etc, but they have proved futile.

As the department fails to seize any valuable tusks from the possession of
the poachers and arrest anybody in connection with the poaching of animals,
it raises eyebrows on the efficiency of the forest officials here.

On the Wildlife Day on October 5, the animal and nature lovers expressed
serious concern over the trend here.

In a tragic incident, 'Rowdy Ranga', an elephant of the Matthigodu Elephant
Camp in Nagarhole, died after being hit by a private bus in the early hours
of Monday. The incident took place around 3.30 am on the Virajpet-Bengaluru
road, near the Nagarhole Tiger Reserve.

According to a note by the Forest Department, Hunsuru division, the
incident occurred due to the negligence of the driver of Kalpaka Travels
bus, as he was found to be speeding on the road.

Police officials from Ponnampet Police Station are investigating the
incident. The bus was reportedly traveling from Kannur to Bengaluru and was
being driven by Ismail Nalakath Bin Khadar, a 40-year-old driver hailing
from Kannur.

46-year-old Ranga was severely injured in the incident in the hip and the
back, while 35 passengers, traveling in the bus, escaped unharmed.
Veterinary doctors from the Rajiv Gandhi National Park attended to the
elephant.

However, in spite of attempts to treat Ranga, he breathed his last at
around 7.30 am on Monday. Ranga was brought to the elephant camp in
Nagarhole around three years ago from Bannerghatta National Park limits in
Ramanagara.

A senior forest official explained that it was common for elephants to be
left free in the night. ""The elephants are fed at 5 pm and then they are
let out and are fed the next morning.

This is a common practice at the park. Incidents like these happen on this
road. One of the common reasons is because of the increased traffic on the
roads through Nagarhole following the ban on night traffic in Bandipur and
Nagarhole roads,” says Kantharaju HC, a retired forest official.

Kantharaju recounts that an Indian gaur was killed in a similar incident on
the same road two years ago. “In that incident, the animal died on the
spot. Drivers go at high speed on the roads at night. There should at least
be speed breakers on the road,"" added Kantharaju.

Night traffic is currently banned in the Bandipur Tiger reserve. Karnataka
and Tamil Nadu have consistently agreed on a night traffic ban while Kerala
has been opposing the move. Bandipur and Nagarhole tiger reserves are 90 km
apart in the southern part of Karnataka.

The elephant population in Hassan and Kodagu districts of Karnataka has
been threatened by repeated construction activities that have resulted in
the loss of lives and fragmentation of habitats in the last four decades.

The Hemavathi, Harangi, and Chiklihole reservoirs have come up during this
time, along with highways, power lines, pipelines and hydel projects.

This has disconnected the forests of Kattepura and Yedavanadu-Aanekaadu in
north Karnataka from the southern forests of Dubaree, Mavukal, Demavachi in
Kodagu district.",1

BARGARH: The carcass of an elephant was found with its tusks missing at
Dejuan under Lakhanpur forest range in Bargarh district on Thursday.

The matter came to light when some locals spotted the carcass and alerted
the forest department officials.

According to forest personnel, the carcass of the wild animal indicates
that it died a few days ago. It is suspected that poachers could have
killed the animal and removed its tusks.
The carcass has been sent for autopsy to ascertain the exact reason behind
the animal’s death.

An investigation is underway to identify the perpetrators of the incident.",1

NARASINGHPUR: A tusker sustained critical injuries after it was shot at by
a poacher at Chandragiri reserve forest on the fringes of Guptamanik
village under Narsinghpur east forest circle range in Cuttack district, a
report said Wednesday.

The matter came to the fore after locals noticed the tusker lying on road
near Mahulmada village and writhing in pain.

On being informed, forest officials led by assistant conservator of forests
(ACF) Purna Chandra Guru, east circle ranger Abhiram Jena rushed to the
spot and started treatment of the ailing animal with the help of
veterinarians. However, the health condition of the tusker remained
critical due to loss of excessive blood.

Preliminary inquiries indicated that the poacher might have shot the tusker
to kill it for its ivory as forest officials have stopped regular
patrolling of the forests in regular intervals due to the presence of
Sundari tigress of Satkosia sanctuary in Narsinghpur forest.

According to villagers, the pachyderms are frequenting the villages on the
fringes of the forests regularly during daytime over last few days and
causing significant damage to their crops on their farmlands.

However, the forest officials have not done anything to alleviate their
fear. It is claimed that the incident might have taken place three to four
days back but the silence of the forest officials about its condition
sparked surprise as well as anger among villagers.

When contacted, the ACF said the condition of the animal continued to
remain critical despite veterinarians administering treatment. They are
closely monitoring its condition which they hope will improve soon, he
added.",1

The mishap happened apparently because of sagging electric wire, he said.
While three carcasses were lying on a road, four others were inside a
canal. The incident took place when the herd was moving toward a canal road
from a nearby paddy field.

Senior forest officials including Divisional Forest Officer of Dhenkanal
Sudarsan Patra and ACF Das rushed to the spot and arrangements were made
for shifting the carcasses, said an official.

CHACHOENGSAO: Two people were killed and nine others injured, eight badly,
when a van carrying them for a ""thod krathin"" merit-making ceremony a
temple hit a wild elephant crossing a road in Sanam Chai Khet district
early on Saturday.

The pachyderm was also injured and fled into Lad Krathing forest plantation
following the crash that occurred in Ban Huay Som village, tambon Lad
Krathing at around 5am, said Pol Lt Col Nurat Chanthakhun, investigation
chief at Sanam Chai Khet police station. Police found a van with Bangkok
licence plates was badly damaged about 500m from a bridge across Huay Som
canal.

The van driver, identified later as Somchai Sapsamruay, 54, and female
passenger Yada Saennamwong, 47, were killed. Their bodies were trapped in
the wreckage. Nine other passengers, eight of whom were women, were hurt.
All but one were seriously injured and rushed to a nearby hospital. A
toenail of the elephant involved in the crash was found and there were also
traces of blood in the nearby forest.

A police investigation found that the ill-fated van and two other vans were
on the way to take a group of residents in Tha Takiab district of
Chachoengsao to Roi Et province for a thod krathin religious ceremony. The
vans left the district at 4am. The van involved in the crash was the second
one, with 11 people including the driver. When it arrived at the scene, a
large elephant suddenly emerged from the forest and crossed the road.

As visibility was poor due to heavy fog, the driver did not see the jumbo
was crossing the road. The van then rammed into the pachyderm, which fell
on the front section of the van and its windshield. The force of the crash
killed two and injured other passengers on board.

The elephant, believed to sustain injuries, fled to the forest. Officials
at Khao Ang Rue Nai wildlife sanctuary were despatched to look for the
injured jumbo. They had yet to find the animal. Boonmee Khaodee, 52, the
driver of the first van, said the three vans were on the way to take 30
passengers for the merit-making ceremony in northeastern Roi Et province.

When he drove near the scene, he noticed one elephant stood at the
construction site of an iron fence about 20m from the road. Shortly later,
the following van got involved in the crash. He drove back to the crash
scene. The elephant fell on the front of the van. It subsequently got up
and fled into the forest. He alerted the driver of the third van about the
crash.

Later in the afternoon, another wild elephants was injured when a SUV
rammed into it on a road in Saman Chai Khet district, not far from the
scene of a fatal crash involving a van and one elephant early in the
morning.

The second crash occurred at around 3.40pm on security road No 3259, or
Chachoengsao-Wang Nam Yen road. The front section of the black SUV with
Bangkok licence plates was badly damaged, but the driver was unhurt.

The driver, whose name was not revealed, said he was driving from Wang Nam
Yen district of Sa Kaeo to buy goods for Sunday’s merit-making at a temple
when five wild elephants emerged from the forest and suddenly crossed the
road. He was unable to apply brakes in time, causing his vehicle to ram
into one of the pachyderms.

The jumbo was hit in the left leg and fled into the forest with the other
elephants. Another team of officials began the search for the second
injured elephant. The accident scene was about 1km away from the scene of
the van-elephant crash.",1

CHACHOENGSAO: An injured elephant - possibly the one hit by a van in a
fatal accident in Lad Krathing forest on Saturday - was spotted by wildlife
officials shortly before an SUV hit another elephant in the same area. The
accident occurred at about 5am on Saturday on a road through the Lad
Krathing forest plantation in Sanam Chai Khet district.

A van taking a group of residents from Tha Ta Kiap district for a ""thod
krathin"" merit-making ceremony in Roi-et province crashed into a herd of
five elephants. Two passengers were killed and nine others injured.

One elephant also believed to be have been hurt in the crash, which badly
damaged the van. At about 3pm, 10 hours after the accident, officials from
the Khao Ang Rue Nai wildlife sanctuary spotted a herd of five elephants
walking across Road 4014 which runs through the Lad Krathing forest
plantation, said Yu Senatham, director of the 2nd Forest Conservation
Office of the Wildlife, National Parks and Plant Conservation Department.

One of the elephants, about five years old and weighing about five tonnes,
was walking unsteadily on an injured leg. The injury was not believed
serious. About 40 minutes after the sighting, another accident occurred
when an SUV struck a herd of five elephants crossing rural Road 3259, the
ChachoengsaoWang Nam Yen road.

The SUV was badly damaged. The driver, who was not hurt, said his vehicle
hit one elephant in the left leg. Wildlife officials speculated the
elephants in the two accidents were from the same herd. Me Yu said
officials and veterinarians will on Sunday scour the forest plantation to
locate the injured elephants for medical treatment.

SUNDERGARH: Rourkela Divisional Forest Officer (DFO) Sanjay Swain today
suspended two forest officials for dereliction of duty after a wild
elephant was killed and later set on fire by locals at Sunakhandi village
under Rajgangpur Forest Range in the district.

The DFO also served show-cause notice to the two officers identified as
Harish Jena and Sabita Kishan. Meanwhile, police arrested a person and
detained three others in connection with the incident.

Sources said a herd of elephants were wreaking havoc in the area 10 days
ago. Besides destroying crops, the pachyderms had crushed two villagers to
death.

Angry over this, a group of locals killed the elephant and later buried it
five day ago. After the news surfaced yesterday, the locals again set the
carcass of the animal on fire to destroy evidence.

Search is on to nab others involved in the incident and stern action will
be taken against all the culprits, the DFO said.",1

ANGUL: The deaths of three tuskers in Angul district this month have
sparked concern among animal lovers and wildlife experts. While two adult
tuskers were electrocuted by poachers, the third died due to ill health.

Poachers shot dead a 35-year-old tusker in the Badagunda jungle of Khamar
forest range in Deogarh forest division November 9 night. They also took
away its tusks worth lakhs.

Although forest officials managed to identify the culprits, no arrests have
been made. “We have identified the culprits who killed the tusker. We have
also conducted raids but could not nab them. They may have fled to
neighbouring districts. We hope to get them soon,” said Ramakanta Sethy,
Range Officer of Khamar Range.

Five days after the tusker’s killing in Khamar range, another tusker was
electrocuted in Handapa forest range.

The 30-year-old elephant also died after coming in contact with a live wire
laid by poachers to kill boars near Hemamura village of Athmallick forest
division.

The tusker belonged to a five-member herd that had strayed into the
division from Angul. Five persons were arrested by forest officials in this
connection.

“We identified the villagers who laid the live wire. The five have been
arrested and presented in court,” said Athmallick DFO S. Samantaray.

Similarly, an 8-year-old tusker died in the Jilinda range of Satkosia wild
life division November 23. Although the exact reason for the death has not
been ascertained, forest officials said that it died of ill health.

Expressing concern over the continuous deaths of elephants in the district,
animal lovers urged the forest authorities to take proactive steps to
counter it.

“Elephant corridors should be improved, intelligence gathering strengthened
and training imparted to tracking teams to detect live wires and prevent
the killings of wild animals,” a local said.

Strict action must be taken against poachers who kill wild animals like
tuskers, tigers, boars and deer, he added.

BHUBANESWAR: Two tuskers were electrocuted after coming in contact with
high tension wires in separate incidents in Mayurbhanj and Angul districts,
Wednesday.

A report from Baripada said, a 12-year-old tusker was electrocuted after
coming in contact with an 11kV wire at Sunaposi forest under Baripada
forest division in Mayurbhanj district.

It is alleged the mishap occurred due to lack of coordination between the
Energy and Forest department. The 11-kv transmission wire was dangling 10
ft above the ground. Forest officials suspect that the mishap might have
occurred due to the sagging high transmission wires.

started an investigation into the incident. Though the energy department
was apprised of the elephant movement in the area, no steps were taken by
it, he added.

Another case of electrocution of elephants has come to the fore, this time,
from Assam.

A wild tusker was electrocuted in Nambar Nadi tea estate in Bokajan on
Friday after it came in contact with a live high voltage electric wire.

Residents in the vicinity spotted the lifeless body of the elephant and
immediately intimated the forest officials and the police.

Locals have alleged that negligence on the part of the power department led
to the death of the elephant.

In the recent past, a number of cases of elephant deaths by electrocution
have been reported in the country.

An elephant was electrocuted to death on Thursday after coming in contact
with an 11kv electric line in Mayurbhanj's Sansarasposi village in Odisha
on Thursday, just over two weeks after seven elephants died after coming in
contact with non-rectification of sagging lines and non-cabling of
transmission lines in another district in the state.

Data from the environment ministry shows that 655 elephant deaths took
place in India from 2009 to 2017. The reasons for the death of tuskers
include electrocution, train accidents, poaching, and poisoning.",1

The Second Army Region’s Suranaree Task Force is to seek help from Laos to
find the killers of an elephant in a national park in the border province
of Ubon Ratchathani.

Deputy national police chief Pol General Srivara Rangsibhramanakul said
yesterday the spent bullet found in the body of a male elephant was from an
AK47 rifle, a weapon not used in Thailand.

He did not mention the name of the country the task force contacted to
help, saying only that it was a neighbouring country. However, Ubon
Ratchathani is close to Laos.

The remains of the elephant were found near Huay Sai Yai waterfall in
BuntarikYod Mon Wildlife Sanctuary on Friday. Officials believe it was shot
in the mouth and the bullet penetrated to the back of the animal's body.

Officials believe the animal did not die at the scene of the shooting.

Basing on photos from camera traps installed in the area, the killers are
believed to be a group of armed men in camouflage clothing. The men, using
GPS tracking devices, were believed to have entered the area for illegal
logging.

Authorities believe the men did not intend to kill the animal as its organs
were still intact.

Srivara said that although the elephant was found in the national park, it

BANDA ACEH, INDONESIA: A Sumatran elephant has been found dead with its
tusks removed in an apparent poaching case targeting the critically
endangered animal, an Indonesian conservation official said Friday (Nov 16).

The 10-year-old male's rotting corpse was found in Blang Awe village in
Aceh province earlier this week.

""His tusks were missing and there were traces of blood in the location
where he was found,"" Aceh conservation centre head Sapto Aji Prabowo told
AFP.

Officials estimated the animal had been dead for at least a week when the
carcass was discovered.

The cause of death was not immediately clear because the body was badly
decomposed, Prabowo said.

Tissue samples will be analysed for signs of poisoning.

Rampant deforestation has reduced the species' natural habitat and brought
them into conflict with humans, while their tusks are prized in the illegal
wildlife trade.

At least 11 wild elephants died in Aceh last year, most of them killed by
humans.

In July, a Sumatran elephant was found dead from apparent poisoning in a
palm oil plantation.

The environment ministry estimates only around 500 Sumatran elephants
remain in Aceh.

TANGI: While several incidents of anti-wildlife activities are being
reported from across the State, an ailing elephant was found struggling for
life in a crop field at Haladibasanta village under Dalijoda forest range
here in Cuttack district.

The locals spotted the tusker lying in the field and informed the forest
department for treatment.

The elephant was found feeling complication to move its head and body.

According to reports, a herd of elephants were found moving at the village
a week ago. While six elephants had returned to the forest, one elephant,
which was supposed to be ill, could not be to make its way back.

Last night, the elephant herd had again visited the village to take the
sick animal with them. However, they went back to the forest leaving the
elephant alone in the crop field.

The forest officials and veterinary doctors were yet to reach the spot till
the last report came in.",2

ERODE: A 25-year-old tusker was killed after it came into contact with live
wires of an illegal electric fence erected around a maze field near
Kermalam here on Friday. Forest officials have arrested the land owner in
connection with the incident.

According to forest officials, the carcass of the elephant was first
spotted by villagers near the maze field on the early hours of Friday. The
villagers immediately alerted the Kermalam forest officials.

Preliminary investigation revealed that the land owner, identified as K
Rangaraj, 42, of Sujalkarai Meesaikarathotti village near Kermalam, had
installed an electric fence around the field to protect the crop from the
wild elephant raid.

“He hadn’t obtained any permission from the concerned officials to erect
the electric fence,” a forest official said. The village, he said, was
situated adjacent to the Kermalam reserve forest.

“On Friday around 4am, the elephant ventured out of the reserve forest to
taste the maize in Rangaraj’s land. As it tried to damage the fence using
its trunk, the tusker accidently touched the live wires and died on the
spot.”

The official said Rangaraj had taken electric supply to the fence from the
state government’s free electricity scheme. “He usually connects the
electric line to the fence at night and disconnects it at dawn. We have
arrested Rangaraj and registered a case against him.”

The carcass was, meanwhile, buried in the forest area after postmortem.",1

ANGUL: The deaths of three tuskers in Angul district this month have
sparked concern among animal lovers and wildlife experts. While two adult
tuskers were electrocuted by poachers, the third died due to ill health.

Poachers shot dead a 35-year-old tusker in the Badagunda jungle of Khamar
forest range in Deogarh forest division November 9 night. They also took
away its tusks worth lakhs.

Although forest officials managed to identify the culprits, no arrests have
been made. “We have identified the culprits who killed the tusker. We have
also conducted raids but could not nab them. They may have fled to
neighbouring districts. We hope to get them soon,” said Ramakanta Sethy,
Range Officer of Khamar Range.

Five days after the tusker’s killing in Khamar range, another tusker was
electrocuted in Handapa forest range.

The 30-year-old elephant also died after coming in contact with a live wire
laid by poachers to kill boars near Hemamura village of Athmallick forest
division.

The tusker belonged to a five-member herd that had strayed into the
division from Angul. Five persons were arrested by forest officials in this
connection.

“We identified the villagers who laid the live wire. The five have been
arrested and presented in court,” said Athmallick DFO S. Samantaray.

Similarly, an 8-year-old tusker died in the Jilinda range of Satkosia wild
life division November 23. Although the exact reason for the death has not
been ascertained, forest officials said that it died of ill health.

Expressing concern over the continuous deaths of elephants in the district,
animal lovers urged the forest authorities to take proactive steps to
counter it.

“Elephant corridors should be improved, intelligence gathering strengthened
and training imparted to tracking teams to detect live wires and prevent
the killings of wild animals,” a local said.

Strict action must be taken against poachers who kill wild animals like
tuskers, tigers, boars and deer, he added.

A 15-year-old wild elephant was killed by suspected poachers in Pathein
township of Ayeyarwady Region, the regional Forest Department said on
Monday.

U Khin Maung Myint, director of the Ayeyarwady Forest Department, said
residents notified officials in the area the elephant had been killed with
a poison arrow.

He said a combined team of officers from the department, forest police,
Elephant Emergency Response Unit and police found the dead elephant, which
had been skinned, in Chaung Thar forest.

U Khin Maung Myint said a suspect was taken into custody and is being
questioned about the incident.

“We burned the body of the elephant,” he said.

The male elephant was about, had an 3.4 metre girth, and was 2.4 metres
tall. Department experts said the animal may have been killed on Saturday.

>From January to September, seven wild elephants died in Ayeyarwady, three
of them killed by poachers. Seven suspected poachers have been arrested in
the region, authorities said.

The killing of wild elephants continues in Ayeyarwady despite patrols by
the police, Forest Department and environmental groups.

Asian elephants are listed as endangered and are threatened by habitat loss
and degradation, as well as poaching. In Myanmar, 80 percent of elephants
are domesticated and only 20pc are living in the wild.

RAIPUR: The elephants of Barnawapara Sanctuary have once again strolled out
of the forests in search of food/water at Arang, keeping the Forest
Department on its toes nearly 30 kilometres from the Capital city.

Senior Veterinary of Forest Department Dr Jai Kishore Jadia told ‘The
Hitavada’, one of the calves from the herd has been injured.

The Calf aged around 15 to 20 days has wounds all over the body and
back-right limb has swelling, indicating towards an injury. He had
administered some treatment to the calf, but it then got surrounded by the
herd of 17 elephants at Chaprid (Gullu).

It’s impossible to go anywhere near to injured baby elephant now. On Friday
night, villagers had rescued the baby when it fell in a ditch. Since the
calf is surrounded by his family, they can only watch it from a safe
distance.

Entire field staff, officials of Raipur and Mahasamund Range along with the
police personnel are on watch 500 meters from the herd and will stay on
guard till the jumbos go back to sanctuary.

The herd is peaceful like always, however, real trouble makers are the
villagers swarming the spot and defying the expert advice of maintaining
safe distance.

These elephants have made the Barnawapara their home for past few years and
they often stroll out of the park in search of water/food and return
without causing any harm to anyone, but just crops.

According to the information, villagers spotted the herd at Samoda coming
from the direction of Mahasamund on Saturday and quickly reported the
Forest Officials.

Team of Forest Department and Police stopped the herd from entering the
populated areas.

DHENKANAL: After battling with life for three days, an eight-month-old
jumbo calf breathed its last during treatment Tuesday.

Even as animal lovers are yet to come to term with the death of seven
tuskers due to electrocution in Dhenkanal, the death of the pachyderm has
again brought resentment among animal lovers.

Officials revealed the jumbo calf was facing trouble in breathing and was
affected with an infection in its mouth. It was not able to take food due
to the infection. It was also suffering from fever.

It was undergoing treatment with fluid therapy and antibiotics in Orissa
University of Agriculture and Technology (OUAT) in Bhubaneswar. Officials
performed the autopsy of the carcass and buried it.

It may be noted here that the calf was first spotted lying unwell inside
Hitinda forest under Hindol forest area in this district.

Locals spotted the pachyderm Saturday morning and alerted the forest
officials. After getting information, forest officials reached the forest
and began the treatment of the pachyderm.

First the forest officials Sudarshan Patra, Assistant Conservator of Forest
(ACF) Jitendra Nath Das, Ranger Madhusdan Patra, and Forester Bikram Sethi
rescued the jumbo and took it to the local veterinary hospital. After
preliminary treatment, the forest officials had transported it to
Bhubaneswar for further treatment. However, the efforts of the officials
turned futile.

The rising deaths of jumbos in the state have now become a matter of
concern. A day back, an elephant calf was spotted dead inside Satkosia
forest. The report comes days after the death of Royal Bengal Tiger
‘Mahavir’ in Satkosia.

Similarly, a pachyderm was knocked down to death by a speeding train in
Keonjhar. Moreover, three more tuskers were electrocuted to death in
Keonjhar and Angul district a few days back.

This apart, the death of seven elephants in Dhenkanal due to electrocution
is yet to erase from the mind of animal lovers.

Locals expressed resentment over the rise in the number of jumbo deaths and
demanded immediate steps in this regard.",1

Officials said that high voltage transmission lines running through the
area, suspended at a height of seven to nine feet, had caused death of five
elephants.

Tamil Nadu Transmission Corporation Limited (TANTRANSCO) has begun
deepening the ground under the low-lying power transmission line at the
spot in the Meghamalai Reserve Forest where five elephants were
electrocuted in a span of three months.

Officials said deepening the stretch would prevent further deaths.

The initiative was taken after the death of two elephants, aged between
seven and 12, on Monday.

All the five elephants met their end at the same spot at Tower Saragam in
Cumbum East Range of Venniyar Reserve Forest.

S. Kalanithi, Wildlife Warden, Meghamalai Wildlife Sanctuary, said the
extra high voltage transmission lines running through the area, suspended
at a height of seven to nine feet, had caused the death.

A senior official said a 40-metre-long and 10-metre-wide pathway with a
maximum depth of seven metres will be dug by manually removing the rocks.

“The Forest department has not given us permission for blasting,” he added.

Twenty TANTRANSCO employees with the permission of the Forest Department
did a survey at the spot on Saturday to chart out the pathway, he said.

The officer said the transmission lines running through Venniyar Estate are
part of a hydroelectric project and were laid in 1958, adding that several
factors make it difficult to raise the height of the transmission lines, an
alternative solution demanded by environmental activists.

“It may be difficult to gauge the status of the lines as they are old. The
tower weighs at least 10 tonnes and it will have to be carried manually for
more than 10 km. The completion will take a long time. The construction of
the tower too demands deepening of the ground by about four metres to lay a
foundation,” he said.

‘Permanent Solution’

On the contrary, he said that the deepening of the ground under the
transmission line can be easily implemented and it can act as a permanent
solution.

Environmentalists, however, raised furore over the proposal and claimed
that manually removing the rocks would require permission from the National
Board for Wildlife, part of the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate
Change as they would be altering the landscape.

Denying that permission was provided to TANTRANSCO’s proposal, Mr.
Kalanithi said the team from the department had only visited the spot but
did not start work.

He said that the department wanted to raise the height of the line between
23 to 30 feet by installing a tower depending on the slope.

When asked if measures have been taken by the Forest Department to prevent
elephant deaths, he said, “We have begun temporary work but the details
cannot be disclosed.”

The Principal Chief Conservator of Forests was unavailable for comment.

A man has been killed by an elephant after his speeding car hit the animal
near a national park in Thailand, police have said.

When the vehicle struck the elephant’s hind legs, it responded by stomping
on the car, destroying the engine and killing the driver, said lieutenant
colonel Kemchat Paedkaew.

The accident happened on Wednesday on a small road with signs telling
drivers to be aware of wild animals that sometimes stray from Khao Yai
National Park in the northeastern part of the country.

Mr Paedkaew said the driver was not local and failed to slow down when he
encountered the elephant.

“Elephants don’t come out during the day but they start coming out when it
gets dark,” he said, adding that up to two people a year are killed by
elephants in areas surrounding the park.

The elephant was guided back to the park and is being looked after by
officials.

It comes weeks after a German woman was trampled to death by an elephant as
she tried to take a photograph of the animal in Zimbabwe.

In 2015, visitors to Khao Yai were warned to be careful, after attacks by
elephants had previously damaged cars, a shop and a restaurant.",1

SHIVAMOGGA: A female elephant calf that was rescued from Yettinahole in
Sakleshpur of Hassan district was shifted to the Sakrebailu elephant camp
in Shivamogga on Friday evening.

With this, the number of elephant calfs in the camp has risen to four. The
entire staff at Sakrebailu elephant camp are happy about the entry of the
calf.

Their job to ‘tame’ this wild elephant has already begun.

The calf was born to the wild elephant that was recently trapped in slush
near Kadagaravalli village of Sakleshpur taluk.

Though the elephant was rescued, she succumbed to her injuries on November
28.

So, senior forest department officials had decided to shift the baby to
Sakrebailu elephant camp. As per the directions of forest officers, a team
of six, including mahouts, jamedar and kavadis went to Yettinahole to
escort the calf.",1

BENGALURU/SHIVAMOGGA: A young wild elephant died of electrocution after it
came in contact with a live wire, laid along the fence of a farmland, near
Huruvanahalli in the Lakkavalli zonal forest area at Tarikere taluk in
Chikkamagaluru district, on Friday.

This tusker’s death takes the total number of elephant deaths by
electrocution to 15 in the past two years. This is the fourth elephant to
have died this week and the second elephant to die by electrocution in a
month.

The male elephant was 25 to 30 years of age. Forest department sources have
revealed that the electric fencing was “illegally laid to protect crop from
wild animals”.

A land case has been booked against Ayyappa, Murga, Raj and on a MESCOM
engineer, under the Wildlife Protection Act.

Officers of the department visited the spot. A postmortem will be conducted
on Saturday.

This is the second elephant to die of electrocution in the area in a month.

The Lakkavalli Range has lately become a death trap for elephants, with
many farmers illegally electrifying their farm fences.

Ayyappa, the owner of the farmland, who is absconding, had fixed the
illegal electric fence on the D-Line, where his farm abuts the forest. A
police case has been filed against him for the theft of power.

In the last two years, 19 animals have been electrocuted in Shivamogga,
Hassan, Chikkamagaluru, Chamrajnagara and Kodagu. Fifteen elephants have
been electrocuted in Lakkavalli, Tanigebailu, Bandipur-Nagarhole,Virajpet,
HD Kote, and Siddapura.",1

BARGAON:  An adult tusker was Sunday found battling for life following
critical injuries on its trunk and foot in Rajgangpur jungle under Bargaon
forest range in Sundargarh district.

Villagers living on the fringes of the forest noticed the animal limping
with great pain and eating leaves by kneeling on the ground a few months
back. The tusker is part of a herd from Jharkhand which has been straying
into the district for the last two years. The injury was noticed when it
strayed into Dahijira jungle a few months ago.

With its condition remaining critical, the pachyderm is slowly inching
towards death in the absence of treatment. The bottom part of its trunk was
found hanging as the injury has become septic.

It is apprehended, that the bottom part of the trunk might get detached
from the body anytime.

The villagers demanded the immediate intervention of forest officials for
its treatment. They claimed that the animal has also a deep injury on its
foot after it possibly stamped on a broken liquor bottle thrown by
picnickers in the forest.

However, the actual reason behind the injury on its trunk is yet to be
ascertained.",1

A male wild elephant was suspected to be electrocuted at Majgaon village of
Kalakhowa area located around 24-km from Dibrugarh town on Tuesday morning.

A two-month baby elephant was rescued near the carcass of the elephant by
forest official and took it to Khowang range office.

“Villagers informed us about the incident. We rushed to the place and found
that a 12-year old male elephant lying dead on the paddy field. The
elephant may have died due to electrocution as farmers tend to put live
electric wires around their paddy fields to prevent the elephant herds from
destroying their crops. We are waiting for the autopsy report,” said Biraj
Barman, Ranger of Khowang forest range.

The elephant is said to be part of a herd that has ventured out from
Dehing-Medela reserve forest in search of food.

He said that they had rescued a two-month baby elephant from that place and
after giving some treatment brought it to Khowang forest range. “We have
sent the baby elephant to Centre for Wildlife Rehabilitation Conservation
(CWRC) at Kaziranga for treatment. The baby elephant was suffering from
dehydration and too weak,” the Ranger informed.

“We are not ruling out death of the jumbo due to electrocution. We are
waiting for the autopsy report that is expected on Friday. We will decide
on our next course of action including lodging of FIR in the police station
on the basis of the autopsy report. Now we have the major task to dispose
of the carcass properly before it starts decomposing,” Barman said.

According to the locals, the elephant come out from the nearby forest in
the night in search of food and rampaged their crops. “During winter we
have sleepless nights because of possible raid by wild elephants in our
village. We have reported the matter to the forest department but they are
not taking the matter seriously,” alleged a villager.",1

PALLAHARA: An elephant calf was found dead at Sankhapur jungle under Khamar
forest range in Angul district Friday.

locals who had ventured into the forest for collecting wood and other
supply.

investigation and the body was sent for post-mortem.

The exact reason behind the death of the jumbo calf could only be
ascertained after receipt of autopsy report.

This happens to be the second incident of elephant calf death within a
month.

Similarly, an ailing jumbo calf died under treatment at Orissa University
of Agriculture and Technology (OUAT) in Bhubaneswar November 27.

The baby elephant which was around 8-months old had been rescued by forest
officials from Hitinda Forest under Hindol Forest Range in Dhenkanal
district November 24.

An Indian wild elephant died near the Baraibari border area in Kurigram’s
Rowmari upazila on Monday, local Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB) officials
reported.

Maidul and Saiful, two local residents, said a herd of elephants had
crossed the border Sunday night, destroying crops and causing disturbance.

As the locals tried to drive them away, they witnessed an elephant falling
down near the border.

BGB Baraibari camp Company Commander Subedar Shafik confirmed the incident,
telling reporters that a dead elephant had been spotted near the 1067/6S
pillar area.

He added that the cause of its death could not be determined, but the
Indian Border Security Force (BSF) had been informed and would retrieve its
body soon.

There have been a number of similar incidents in the areas near the
Bangladesh-India border over the last several years, where Indian wild
elephants have strayed into Bangladesh – sometimes entering human habitats.
Some of these stray elephants died or were killed in conflict with humans.

Shortage of food and destruction of habitats, as well as natural disasters
such as floods, forced the elephants to venture out and into human
territory, according to forest officials.

The governments of Bangladesh and India have been in talks to create safe
“corridors” for wild elephants to ensure trans-boundary conservation of the
elephants.

However, the last bilateral talk between the forest and wildlife officials
of the two countries on wild elephant conservation took place in July 2017.",1

A male elephant, aged around 25 years old, was found dead near Suruliyar
lower camp, in Madurai on Tuesday. Since the elephant’s carcass was found
without its tusk, Forest Department officials suspected that it could be a
case of poaching.

This takes the death toll of jumbos in the last three months to six, in the
same Venniyar Reserve Forest area in Cumbum East range - an alarming number
according to environmentalists.

S. Kalanithi, Wildlife Warden, Meghamalai, said that the carcass was found
at Udupiyar saragam near an electricity board station in Cumbum East.

Meanwhile, a senior officer from the Kerala Forest Department said forest
personnel had intercepted two men carrying 10 kgs of ivory cut into four
pieces at the periphery of Kumily town.

“We arrested two men, Ganga and Prabhu, at Rosapoo Kandam in Kumily and
immediately began questioning them. The men admitted that the tusk was
removed from Tamil Nadu forest area in Venniyar,” he said.

Officials from Forest Departments of both States said that they are trying
to establish a connect between the two events.

The two accused and the ivory would be brought to the spot to ascertain
whether the tusk belonged to the dead elephant.

Officials from the Kerala Forest Department are expected to reach Venniyar
in the afternoon.

“If it is found that the accused have removed the tusk, they would be
handed over to the Tamil Nadu Forest Department,” said a source from the
Kerala Forest Department in Thekkady.

Mr. Kalanithi stated that the post-mortem would be conducted in the evening
to ascertain the cause of death and to check if it was accidental.",4

NAINITAL: Forest officials recovered the carcass of a female elephant from
Sarpudali range of Corbett Tiger Reserve (CTR) late on Wednesday night.
They suspect that the jumbo was killed in a tiger attack in the protected
area.

According to forest department sources, the carcass was also mutilated by
the big cat.

CTR director Rahul (who goes by his first name) said, “Preliminary
investigation into the death of the pachyderm indicates that it was killed
by a big cat, most probably a tiger. We have preserved the viscera of the
animal for further tests.”

Sources said that forest officials patrolling the area spotted the carcass
on Wednesday night and alerted higher authorities.

On information, senior officials rushed to the spot and sent the carcass
for postmortem. It was later cremated. Data available with the forest
department has revealed that nine elephants have died in the reserve this
year, of which four deaths were due to natural causes.

At least four elephants have died in Rajaji Tiger Reserve too. Speaking
about the rising number of jumbo deaths in Corbett, Nainital-based wildlife
activist Anup Sah said, “Apart from natural causes, many a time animals die
due to human factors. This is a serious threat to the ecological system of
the area.”",2

ATHAGARH: A female elephant, aged about eight years old, was found dead at
Rajanagar under Athagarh forest range here on Wednesday morning.

Locals first spotted the pachyderm lying in a pool of blood in a brinjal
field near their village. On being informed, forest officials led by
Assistant Conservator of Forest (ACF) Rajendra Kumar Das and Range Officer
Rabindra Nayak rushed to the spot.

A team of veterinary surgeons from OUAT led by Prof Dr Niranjan Sahoo also
reached the spot and conducted postmortem on the dead jumbo. Block
Veterinary Officer Susant Kumar Behera also assisted the team.

During autopsy, the doctors found that the elephant’s tongue was chafed and
lower jaws broken. It is suspected that something exploded in the mouth of
the jumbo, leading to severe bleeding and subsequently, its death.

Since fresh blood was oozing out of its mouth, it is believed that the
elephant died early in the morning.

Sources said due to lack of proper patrolling, poachers have become active
in the forest.

Since Sukasan reserve forest has a huge population of wild boars, poachers
use bombs to hunt the animals. As per reports, five elephants have died in
the forest in as many months.

It is alleged that some forest officials are hand in glove with the
poachers and have turned a blind eye to the menace.Expressing concern over
the rising deaths of elephants, environmentalists and wildlife lovers
demanded strict action against poachers and the unscrupulous forest
officials involved in the illegal practice.",3

DEOGARH: A pregnant elephant was electrocuted after coming in contact with

womb during post-mortem,” veterinary surgeon Dr Satyabrata Mishra said.

The matter came to the fore when the villagers had been to their farmland

flowers to the carcass and worshipped it.

ERODE: A 20-year-old tusker was found dead in Sathyamangalam Tiger Reserve
(STR) here on Friday with tusks missing from the carcass. Forest officials
have picked up a few people for questioning.

According to G Arunlal, district forest officer, STR, the carcass was
spotted at Mookanpalayam village, which is situated on Tamil Nadu-Karnataka
interstate border, by local people on Friday morning.

He said the villagers might have removed the tusks before passing on the
information to the forest department.

Veterinarians, who performed postmortem, said the elephant had died of
stomach ailments caused due to ulcer. “The animal seemed to have been sick
for a few weeks and it could have died as it couldn’t take any food,” the
district forest officer said.

After the postmortem, the carcass was buried in the forest. The district
forest department has lodged a complaint with the Sathyamangalam police to
trace the tusks.

Police subsequently pressed a sniffer dog into service to trace the
accused. Preliminary investigation suggested that people living in
Karnataka villages adjoining to STR might have been involved in the case.

Forest officials have picked up a few people from both TN and Karnataka
villages for inquiry. The Sathyamangalam police and the forest officials
have registered separate cases and further inquiries are on.",1

MYSURU: A Forest Department railway track fence, which was built to prevent
man-animal conflict in villages near forests, has claimed the life of an
elephant.

This happened in Veeranahosahalli forest, under Nagarahole National Park
limits, in Hunsur Taluk on Saturday morning.

“Three elephants had strayed into villages on the fringes of
Veeranahosahalli on Friday night. Forest department personnel had driven
them back into the forests. However, one of them, a tusker, aged 42 years,
had not returned.

It was returning to the forest on Saturday, during the wee hours, from
Veeranahosahalli village, when it tried to cross over the railway track
fence. In its efforts, it got stuck in the middle,” said ACF S R Prasanna
Kumar.

Forest department officials said, it was an identified rogue elephant and
it would often raid human habitats. It has tried to cross over the fence
near the official quarters of the RFO in the forest. It has taken the fence
route, even though the gates, leading to the forest, had been kept open,
they said.

It has to be recalled that only a couple of weeks ago, on December 4, Chief
Minister H D Kumaraswamy had announced construction of a 500-km-long
railway track fence at Alur and surrounding villages in Hassan district. He
had given his assurance to the people of Balupet and surrounding villages
after they held a weeklong protest calling for a permanent solution to the
jumbo menace.

Earlier, on December 1, Chamarajanagar MP R Dhruvanarayan had directed the
Forest department officials to erect rail track fence to prevent elephants
from straying into human landscapes, during the District Development
Coordination and Monitoring Committee meeting in the city.

It has to be recalled that the railway track fence was introduced by the
Forest department a few years ago as a fool-proof solution to the straying
of elephants into human habitats. But, now, it has proved fatal to the
elephant, compelling the officials to rethink.

Recently, the Forest department had introduced concrete fence, especially
in forests under Bandipur National Park. They are erected at places where
elephant-proof trenches (EPTs) could not be dug, due to geographical and
geological reasons. Earlier, the concrete structures had nails.

They were removed, following a Supreme Court order, as there were
possibilities of the wild animals getting injured. The cement structure
cost around Rs 6,000 per metre.",2

GANJAM: Carcass of an elephant was recovered at Nimakhandi village under
Digapahandi block in Ganjam district today.

Though the exact reason behind the death of jumbo is unclear, it is
suspected that it could be a case of poaching as holes resembling gunshot
wounds were spotted on the pachyderm’s body.

After spotting the pachyderm lying in a pool of blood locals alerted police
and forest officials.

Forest officials have seized the body of the elephant and soon a
post-mortem will be conducted to establish the exact cause of death of the
pachyderm.

“Primary investigation shows that the elephant died due to bullet injuries.
However, the exact cause of the death of the animal will be known after the
autopsy report comes,” Digapahandi ranger, Paramananda Panigrahi.

A female calf elephant, less than a month old, was found alone, with a
rotten, worm-filled leg caused by a metal trap.

She was found by villagers in Khao Hoi Hua, Moo 8, Amphoe Khao Chamao,
Rayong Province who alerted forest rangers from the Khao Ang Rue Nai
Wildlife Sanctuary and took her on the sidecar of their motorcycle.

The female calf was emancipated from lack of food and milk as her herd had
left her behind for many days before she got free from the trap.

She may have also encountered a pack of wild dogs and fled to a rubber
plantation before meeting with the villagers, said forest ranger Prasan
Puangsook.

The rangers contacted veterinarians from Protected Area Regional Office 2
(Sri Racha). “The wire cut into the front left leg. The wound was rotten
and worms were seen squirming,” said veterinarian Nattanon Panpetch.

They cleaned her infected wounds and gave her antibiotics. They planned to
also conduct a bone x-ray and blood tests and examine her wounds to see if
they needed to amputate her infected foot.

The elephant is now staying in the sanctuary for treatment and
rehabilitation.

According to Wildlife Alliance, snaring is a problem in many forests across
the region, especially in Vietnam and Laos.

It is also found on the rise in Cambodia, Myanmar, Indonesia, and Thailand.

The traps are set up to catch smaller animals like boars and deer but can
also catch medium-to-large animals and strip the forest of its biodiversity.",1

COIMBATORE: Forest department have launched a search for a wild elephant in
the Madhukkarai forest range in Coimbatore division close to the Tamil
Nadu-Kerala border that allegedly suffered a bullet injury on one of its
legs.

A forest source said that a well grown adult male elephant with a single
tusk was found near the Chinnampathy beat in the Madhukkarai forest range a
few weeks ago. It was struggling to walk and had suffered an injury likely
to be caused by a gun bullet.

Efforts to capture the elephant to treat it failed.“We suspect that the
elephant could have escaped from poachers in the neighboring Kerala forest
and entered the Madhukkarai range in Coimbatore forest division,” said
forest sources.

Some tribals sighted the elephant last week.Mr. D. Venkatesh told the DC,
“so far, I haven’t received such information from the range officer. A team
of AP watchers will be deployed in additional patrolling for the elephant,

BARIPADA: The carcass of an elephant calf was found on Odisha-West Bengal
border on Friday.

The carcass was spotted at Dhumsahi village under Kesharekha range of
Kharagpur forest division of West Bengal. The calf is around five years
old.

The calf was part of a herd which had strayed from Dalma forest in
neighbouring Jharkhand to Dhumsahi village. In the village it consumed
excess mahua poch and paddy.

After some time, it started trumpeting and moved around the village leading
to panic among the residents.

The villagers and forest personnel did not approach the calf as it was
surrounded by the herd on Thursday night.

Villagers returned to the spot after the herd left for Dalma forest and
found the carcass, said sources.

Baripada Divisional Forest Officer Swayam Mallik said the carcass was found
in Dhumsahi village bordering West Bengal.

“A herd of 100 jumbos, including 20 calves, had entered  into Mayurbhanj.
The calf was part of the herd and died after consuming excess amount of
‘mahua poch’ and paddy. The herd returned to Dalma forest through
Odisha-West Bengal corridor. As the spot where the carcass was found falls
under West Bengal forest department’s jurisdiction, forest personnel of
Kharagpur range have been informed of the calf’s death,” he added.",1

In the raging man-elephant conflict in Goalpara district of Lower Assam a
full grown male elephant got electrocuted at Mariyampur village near
Athiabari reserve under Rongjuli range forest this morning.

The incident occurred when the pachyderm pressed itself against a pair of
electricity posts.

The electricity posts suddenly got uprooted and the high voltage live wires
killed the animal.

“We could hear the wailing sound of the dying elephant from our home which
is five hundred metres from the scene. Our people are very sad at the death
despite the harassment we face because invading wild elephants”, informed
Bipul Rabha, a local youth.

The forest department buried the animal near the scene with due process.

“We have conducted the postmortem and buried it. However, we have found
that the jumbo had deep injuries in its hind legs. It was a man-inflicted
injury by sharp weapons like spear and the elephant probably tried to get
relief from the injury by rubbing the cut with the electricity posts”, said
Balen Das, ranger of Rongjuli range forest.

It may be mentioned that this season of harvesting of Sali paddy has
witnessed worse man-elephant conflict and several people have died at
because attack by wild elephants.

Balijana have been the worst affected. Four persons including a mother and
her eight-year-old daughter were killed in the district by wild elephants
during the last 36 hours.

PHULBANI/TUMUDIBANDH: An elephant was found dead at a jungle near
Belghar-Jhiripani road under Belghar forest limits in Kandhamal district
Thursday.

The elephant is said to be four to five years old. However, the manner in
which the forest personnel tried to conceal the incident from the villagers
and hurriedly buried the carcass has raised many eyebrows.

Jhiripani sarpanch Arjun Patra alleged that the forest personnel without
informing him as the local people’s representative hurriedly buried the
carcass at late night after conducting its post-mortem. Patra said he and
other villagers were barred from visiting the site while the post-mortem
was conducted.

He alleged that the forest wing in the area has become complacent and is
not taking any steps to save the villagers from crop damage by the
pachyderms nor is monitoring the movement of the animals.

Villagers suspected that the animal might be a tusker and might have been
decapitated by poachers for its ivory.

Their suspicion stems from the fact that the forest officials while
claiming that it as a female elephant are only showing the photograph of
its rear portion.

Netra Manseth, former wildlife warden of Kotagarh sanctuary, expressed
serious concerns over the lapses and demanded a high-level inquiry.

Sources said the jungle is part of an elephant corridor. When contacted,
forest ranger Mani Chandra Patra ruled out the allegations stating that the
reality over the animal’s death will be known after availability of the
post-mortem report.",1

SILIGURI: With the winter cold intensifying, north Bengal is witnessing one
after another poaching or mystery deaths of wild animals.

In the latest case, an adult wild elephant has been found dead at Bengdubi
forest near Bagdogra in Siliguri today morning. It was a tusker of around
10-years-old.

The location where the elephant has been found dead, is not very far from
the Bengdubi base of the Indian Army. It comes under Kurseong forest
division.

On receiving information from people living in nearby villagers, a team of
foresters went to the spot and retrieved the carcass for post-mortem.

It is not yet clear as to how the wild animal has died but the possibility
of an attack by poachers to steal its tusks has not been ruled out.

This is the fourth wild animal death in north Bengal since 25 December. On
the day of Christmas, a rhino was found dead in Jaldapara Wildlife
Sanctuary.

This was followed by the recovery of the carcasses of two wild leopards
from Gargenda tea garden in Alipurduar district on 26 and 27 December.",1

Krishnagiri: Two cow elephants died on Monday after they came into contact with a live Tangedco electric wire that passes through the reserved forest area in Denkannikottai taluk, near Hosur, of Krishnagiri.



On Monday morning, villagers found the carcass of two female elephants near their village and informed the forest range office in Denkannikottai. The officials who arrived at the spot recovered the carcasses. During investigation, they found that the jumbos had entered DenkannikÂ¬ottai village, on the fringes of the western ghats, to drink water from the Ayyur lake.



While on way to the lake, the two attempted to break a tree branch and accidentally came into contact with the live, low-tension wire transporting electricity to Bettamugilalam. The jumbos were electrocuted.



A medical team that conducted the post-mortem confirmed the age of elephants as 10 and 15 years. A.K. Ulaganathan, district forest officer for Krishnagiri, visited the spots where the carcasses were recovered and instructed the range officers to identify places having low-hanging Tangedco wires and make arrangements to remove them.

The dessicated carcass of a dead elephant has been found in Kaeng Krachan National Park, in Phetchaburi province, about three kilometres from where another elephant was found dead on March 8. 
 
Chaiwat Limlikhit-aksorn, the park chief, said he was informed of the find by villagers on Tuesday morning and rushed to the scene. 
 
He said the elephant appeared to have been dead for at least three weeks. It was found near a water reservoir. 
 
The animal's skull was found about three metres from the main carcass. The ivory tusks and the skin had been removed. 
 
There appeared to be bullet holes in the skull, but forensic checks would be needed to confirm this. 
 
Mr Chaiwat said he was believed the elephant was killed by poachers for its ivory. Other marketable parts of the elephant, including the tail hair and its trunk, were untouched. 
 
On March 8, a female elephant believed to be between seven and 10 years old was found dead near a creek in the same national park. 
 
The elephant had several wounds, including four bullet holes in its hide. Two men were arrested as suspects in the poaching of the elephant. 
 
Police later seized around 90 firearms from local people to for tests to determine whether they were used to kill the elephant or not.  No results have been announced.

MYSORE: Close on heels of the death of a leopard in Heggadadevana Kote taluk, two elephants including a calf died in two separate incidents in Mysore district on Monday. A 6-year-old male calf is suspected to have died due to electric shock in Makanapura, Nanjangud taluk whereas 40-year-old tamed elephant, succumbed to illness. 

Mysore division DCF Shashwathi Mishra suspects the death of the calf to be a case of electrocution because it was found dead near a field belonging to one Jayaram, who has electric fence across the field. The DCF claimed that there is a rule that in case a wild animal dies due to electric shock, the case has to be transferred to police for investigation. She suspected that the land owner had illegally tapped power to protect the produce from wildlife. Mishra said,"" Once the postmortem report is ready, we will register a case against Jayaram under Wildlife Protection Act and KEB Act''. Autopsy was conducted by Dr Venkatesh and the report is expected in another two days, the DCF added.

MYSORE: Close on heels of the death of a leopard in Heggadadevana Kote taluk, two elephants including a calf died in two separate incidents in Mysore district on Monday. A 6-year-old male calf is suspected to have died due to electric shock in Makanapura, Nanjangud taluk whereas 40-year-old tamed elephant, succumbed to illness. 

Mysore division DCF Shashwathi Mishra suspects the death of the calf to be a case of electrocution because it was found dead near a field belonging to one Jayaram, who has electric fence across the field. The DCF claimed that there is a rule that in case a wild animal dies due to electric shock, the case has to be transferred to police for investigation. She suspected that the land owner had illegally tapped power to protect the produce from wildlife. Mishra said,"" Once the postmortem report is ready, we will register a case against Jayaram under Wildlife Protection Act and KEB Act''. Autopsy was conducted by Dr Venkatesh and the report is expected in another two days, the DCF added.
