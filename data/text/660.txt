KRISHNAGIRI: A 30-year-old pregnant elephant was found dead near
Denkanikottai on Tuesday.

The forest officials were unable to confirm the cause of the death. "We
have been waiting for the autopsy report to ascertain the cause of
elephant's death," a forest official said.

On Monday evening, people of Dhasarapalli village found the carcass near a
ragi field and informed the forest officials about it. As it was dark, the
forest officials went to the spot on Tuesday morning.

At first, the officials thought that the jumbo might be electrocuted. "But,
there was no live wires nearby," the official said.

A team of veterinarians from Krishnagiri reached the spot and conducted an
autopsy.

They found that the elephant was pregnant. After collecting samples of dung
as well as removing vital organs like liver and spleen, the carcass was
buried inside the reserve forest. The official said the jumbo might have
failed to take food for some time due to ailments.
