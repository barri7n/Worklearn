KOTA KINABALU: Sabah recorded its 26th elephant death for this year as a
juvenile male succumbed to snare trap injuries while undergoing treatment
at Borneon Elephant Sanctuary in Kinabatangan this morning.

State Wildlife Department spokesman Siti Nur’ain Ampuan Acheh said the
juvenile male elephant, aged about 5, was rescued at Ulu Segama Forest
Reserve in Lahad Datu on Tuesday.

“A team consisted of a veterinarian and wildlife rangers was dispatched to
the location to rescue the injured elephant.

“They managed to capture the elephant and initiated treatment,” she said in
a statement, adding the elephant was weak and had suffered a severe and
deep wound which already reached the bone of left front leg.

She added further treatment was supposed to be done at the sanctuary but it
did not respond well to the treatment and died at 8.40am this morning.

“Post mortem was conducted to determine the cause of death.

“Findings revealed that the elephant died due to septicemia which
originated from the severe snare trap injury.”

On Thursday, Sabah Chief Minister Datuk Seri Mohd Shafie Apdal had ordered
the state Tourism, Culture, Environment Minister Christina Liew and
Agriculture and Food Industry Junz Wong to hold special meetings with
plantation owners on the issue.

The initiative is to engage plantation workers to help with the fight
against poaching and killing in their areas.

Liew had said a special unit will be formed when experts from the United
States arrive to address elephants poaching and killing issues in Sabah.
