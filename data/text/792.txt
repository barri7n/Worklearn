Another case of electrocution of elephants has come to the fore, this time,
from Assam.

A wild tusker was electrocuted in Nambar Nadi tea estate in Bokajan on
Friday after it came in contact with a live high voltage electric wire.

Residents in the vicinity spotted the lifeless body of the elephant and
immediately intimated the forest officials and the police.

Locals have alleged that negligence on the part of the power department led
to the death of the elephant.

In the recent past, a number of cases of elephant deaths by electrocution
have been reported in the country.

An elephant was electrocuted to death on Thursday after coming in contact
with an 11kv electric line in Mayurbhanj's Sansarasposi village in Odisha
on Thursday, just over two weeks after seven elephants died after coming in
contact with non-rectification of sagging lines and non-cabling of
transmission lines in another district in the state.

Data from the environment ministry shows that 655 elephant deaths took
place in India from 2009 to 2017. The reasons for the death of tuskers
include electrocution, train accidents, poaching, and poisoning.
