A tusker died after coming in contact with a live electrical wire at IBC
Company coffee estate at Kadlur Koplu village in Alur taluk on Friday
night. The elephant, aged about 25 years, came in contact with 11-kV
sagging power line in the estate, which came to light on Saturday morning,
when workers reached there.

Ganesh S. Bhat, Deputy Conservator of Forests, told The Hindu on Saturday
that negligence of the electricity supply company was the reason for the
incident. The Forest Department would file a case against the
Chamundeshwari Electricity Supply Corporation for the alleged gross
negligence.

Parts of Alur and Sakaleshpur taluks in Hassan district are known for the
conflict between man and animal. In the last 10 years, more than 50 people
have died in elephant attacks and around 35 elephants have died, many of
them due to electrocution. Following constant demand from the people, the
Forest Department conducted a drive to capture wild elephants in the area
and relocate them elsewhere. In the first phase, the department had the
permission to capture 25 elephants in the operation conducted in November
and December of 2014.
