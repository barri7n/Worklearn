BARIPADA: Three elephants, one tusker, one calf and an adult female, were killed in Simlipal. The pair of tusks were missing pointing to the fact that it was the handiwork of the ivory traders. The carcasses were found near Kaleitunda of Karanjia territorial forest division.

Information reaching here on Friday night said ivory smugglers operating in Simlipal had poisoned the pachyderms. Villagers suspect that five elephants might have been killed by the poachers. Field director of Simlipal Tiger Reserve (STR) Anup Kumar Nayak said officials had been dispatched to Simlipal to take stock of the situation.

Wildlife buffs have expressed concern over poachers being active in Simlipal once again. Last year, about 10 elephants were found killed in Similipal. The National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) had also expressed concern over the mass killing of elephants in Simlipal.

In another development, a herd of elephant from Jharkhand's Dalma elephant sanctuary has arrived on the borders of West Bengal close to Deuli forest range of Mayurbhanj district. Exactly a year ago on November 8, 2010, this herd from Dalma had sneaked into Mayurbhanj, causing depredations, damaging standing crops and killing two tribals, divisional forest officer of Baripada B K Panda said. Panda said he has instructed all range officers of Mayurbhanj to create awareness among the border villagers to avert man-elephant conflict when the herd sneaks into Mayurbhanj.
