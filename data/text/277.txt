GUWAHATI: An elephant carcass was found by members of a local NGO in the Lebra Santipur area of Subankhata Reserve Forest in Baksa district under the Bodoland Territorial Area Districts (BTAD) on Sunday.



A forest official said the elephant is suspected to have been killed about 15 days ago.



"The elephant might have been killed by ivory smugglers for its tusks, which are missing," the official said. Subhankata and the adjoining Dihira Reserve Forest are part of an important elephant corridor that connects Manas National Park to Ripu-Chirang and Barnadi wildlife sanctuaries. The areas are also part of the Ripu-Chirang elephant reserve. Both the reserve forests are under the Dhansiri Forest Division of the BTAD.
