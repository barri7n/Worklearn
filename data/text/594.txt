Apathy jolt kills tusker (Purbi Singhbhum District, India)

Jamshedpur:  An adult male elephant was electrocuted in the forests of
Chakulia, 70km from here, in the small hours today apparently when he tried
to cross a mound of soil dumped for a canal job under the Subernarekha
Multipurpose Project.

Jamshedpur DFO Saba Alam Ahmed said the tragedy took place at Bera jungle
between 3am and 4am when a herd of 19 elephants was ambling along the
under-construction canal.

"The soil, dumped by a civil construction firm, was eight feet high. The
mound reduced the gap between the ground and a high-tension overhead
transmission line from 18 feet to 10 feet, which is why the tusker came in
contact with the wire. An 11KV jolt killed him then and there," Ahmed, who
inspected the spot, said.

The DFO said the canal work was part of the multi-crore Subernarekha
Multipurpose Project (SMP) and they would raise the issue with the
department concerned.

"We are conducting an investigation following which we will take up the
matter with the SMP authorities. It is definitely illegal to let
construction materials block pathways, particularly near an elephant
habitat," he added.

A forest department source said the post-mortem was conducted in the
presence of the DFO and other senior department officials.

"The herd has remained anchored at Bera jungle in Chakulia forest range for
the past month. Two villagers have died in man-animal conflict while over
20 thatched houses have been damaged," the source said, expressing fears
that the death of the tusker might further antagonise the herd.
