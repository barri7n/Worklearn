KOTA KINABALU: A female pygmy elephant with multiple gunshot wounds was
found in a plantation close to the Malua Forest Reserve in Sabah’s east
coast Kinabatangan area.

The elephant succumbed to its injuries despite veterinarians from the
Wildlife Rescue Unit (WRU) trying all they could to save it.

Sabah Wildlife Department director Augustine Tuuga could not be reached
immediately although his rangers were investigating the incident after they
were alerted about three days ago.

Danau Girang Field Centre director Dr Benoit Goossens said it could not be
ascertained yet if the elephant was a victim of poachers.

“It was a female elephant, it does not have a tusk. No meat was taken. It
is difficult to say what is the motive. It is sad and senseless,” he said
when contacted.

It is believed that the elephant could have been shot within the Malua
Forest Reserve area. It then fled towards the plantation where workers
spotted it struggling for its life.
