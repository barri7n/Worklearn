In what could be another major loss for the UT Administration, a legally
employed forest tusker is battling for life in the Middle Andaman region.
Mattu served for more than 15 years in the Department of Environment and
Forests, but when the  latest machinery claimed importance, official
indifference started taking lead in our system. If sources are to be
believed, Mattu was found in ‘Musth’ stage last month, but Veterinary
doctors administered wrong medicines following which the elephant
contracted serious infection.

According to information, Mattu was found in the ‘Musth’ stage last month
after which the veterinarians administered some medications. From the
January 26, the tusker developed serious infections on his male organ. As
per the present condition, staff  of the Forest Department are trying their
best to bring the elephant to normalcy. Tied with sacks and other
unsterilized clothes, official apathy is evident . This apathy is under
heavy criticism from the local population here, who have lived for years
with our mammals.

Speaking to this correspondent, the Pradhan of Sundergarh Panchayat, Mr
Biju Gurudasan again demanded proper care for the forest tuskers. “Such
deficiency in care of our nature friends should not happen. I wish Mattu
good health and his recovery as soon as possible. The government machinery
should ensure proper care of friends without any laxity,” says Mr Gurudasan.
