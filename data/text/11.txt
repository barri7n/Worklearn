SOME 100 elephants have been wailing loudly for the past three days to mourn 
the killing of a herd member by poachers in southeastern Bangladesh, a 
report said Saturday.

The dead animal has lain in a pool of blood surrounded by wailing elephants 
since the shooting Wednesday, the Manabzamin daily said.

It said the wails were bringing down the spirits of villagers in Ramu in 
Cox's Bazar district, 290km southeast of the capital Dhaka.
