Two endangered Sumatran elephants have been found dead in Aceh province and
are believed to have been poisoned.

The head of the local Conservation and Natural Resources Agency, Genman
Suhefti Hasibuan, says Thursday the carcasses were discovered by locals in
a forest about 7 kilometers from their village in Aceh's Jaya district.

The two females, 2 years and 15 years of age, were estimated to have died
two or three days before they were found on Wednesday, Hasibuan said. He
added that there were no indications of violence or gunshot wounds on the
carcasses.

The agency will investigate the deaths in cooperation with the police.

At least five Sumatran elephants have been found dead this year in Aceh,
after 11 deaths last year.
