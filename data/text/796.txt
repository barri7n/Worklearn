ERODE: A 25-year-old tusker was killed after it came into contact with live
wires of an illegal electric fence erected around a maze field near
Kermalam here on Friday. Forest officials have arrested the land owner in
connection with the incident.

According to forest officials, the carcass of the elephant was first
spotted by villagers near the maze field on the early hours of Friday. The
villagers immediately alerted the Kermalam forest officials.

Preliminary investigation revealed that the land owner, identified as K
Rangaraj, 42, of Sujalkarai Meesaikarathotti village near Kermalam, had
installed an electric fence around the field to protect the crop from the
wild elephant raid.

“He hadn’t obtained any permission from the concerned officials to erect
the electric fence,” a forest official said. The village, he said, was
situated adjacent to the Kermalam reserve forest.

“On Friday around 4am, the elephant ventured out of the reserve forest to
taste the maize in Rangaraj’s land. As it tried to damage the fence using
its trunk, the tusker accidently touched the live wires and died on the
spot.”

The official said Rangaraj had taken electric supply to the fence from the
state government’s free electricity scheme. “He usually connects the
electric line to the fence at night and disconnects it at dawn. We have
arrested Rangaraj and registered a case against him.”

The carcass was, meanwhile, buried in the forest area after postmortem.
