UDHAGAMANDALAM: Two elephants died of electrocution in the Gudalur range
forests in the Nilgiris on Friday. According to district forest officer PK
Dilip, a herd of seven elephants were roaming in Kothadipudi area near
Devarshola in Gudalur range early Friday. "While the elephants were trying
to grab leaves from an areca nut tree, the tree fell on a live-wire and it
snapped. One male elephant and a female elephant were electrocuted. It was
an unfortunate accident," he said.

While the male elephant was about 12 years old, the female was about 15-20
years old, the official said. Forest staff rushed to the spot after the
incident was reported by the public. "We found a herd of five elephants.
Later, they were chased away into the forest," he added.

A post-mortem was conducted at the spot and samples were collected for lab
test. The carcasses were left in the forest area for natural decay.
Meanwhile, wildlife activists said trees close to electric posts on forest
boundaries should be identified and removed to avoid such accidents.

"In places like Nilgiris, soil is of very soft and earth is mostly wet.
Tall trees with thin trunk have shallow roots compared to indigenous trees
here," said an activist. "If the forest department removes such trees
growing close to electric posts, it will be in the interest of both humans
and wild animals, especially elephants," he further said.

A forest department staff said the department was vigilant about
high-voltage live-wire fencing erected illegally close to forest boundaries.
