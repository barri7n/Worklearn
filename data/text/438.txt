In a second such incident, a tusker was found dead in the Maniabandha
forest range under the Athagarh area in Cuttack district on Friday.

According to reports, some locals first found the tusker lying dead at the
Gobara forest beat under the Khuntuni forest division and informed the
forest officials.

A team of forest officials rushed to the spot and recovered the body of the
elephant, which has bullet piercing marks.

The male elephant might have been killed by poachers, suspected forest
officials. They said the exact reason would be known only after the
post-mortem is conducted.
