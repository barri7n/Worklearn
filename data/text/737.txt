RUDRAPUR: An elephant was electrocuted by a high-power electric line early
on Saturday in the central forest range of Terai division in Pantnagar.

The pachyderm was electrocuted and fell into a pond under the purview of
the fisheries department of GB Pant University.

This is the sixth death of an elephant in the past 15 months in this forest
range.

The carcass was spotted in the morning by local residents and forest
officials were informed.

Forest ranger Harish Ram Arya said, “Prima facie it appears that the
electric line was active and running low which resulted in the pachyderm
accidentally touching it. People said that they heard wails of the animal
sometime at 2 am followed by a power blackout.”

Local residents said that they have witnessed regular elephant activity in
the area but no protective measures have been taken by the forest
department.
