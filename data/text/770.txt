MIDNAPORE: An adult elephant has died in mysterious circumstances in
Jhargram district.

The wild elephant was spotted dead in a paddy field at Kanthi village under
Nayagrampolice station of Jhargram by a farmer today morning. He alerted
the villagers, who, in turn, informed the forest department.

A team from Nayagram forest beat office came and took away the carcass in a
lorry. There are no visible injury marks on the body of the dead elephant
and hence, foresters are not sure what led to its death.

“We are performing a post-mortem of the carcass. Hope this will reveal the
cause of death,” Arup Mukherjee, the divisional forest officer of
Kharagpur, said.

A section of forest officers, however, is already suspecting that the wild
elephant has died either of electric shock or by gulping pesticide kept by
the paddy field.

To keep wild elephant at bay, farmers often install unauthorised
high-voltage power cable around paddy filed or plant food laced with deadly
pesticide.
