BHUBANESWAR: Two tuskers were electrocuted after coming in contact with
high tension wires in separate incidents in Mayurbhanj and Angul districts,
Wednesday.

A report from Baripada said, a 12-year-old tusker was electrocuted after
coming in contact with an 11kV wire at Sunaposi forest under Baripada
forest division in Mayurbhanj district.

It is alleged the mishap occurred due to lack of coordination between the
Energy and Forest department. The 11-kv transmission wire was dangling 10
ft above the ground. Forest officials suspect that the mishap might have
occurred due to the sagging high transmission wires.

Forest officials led by Baripada DFO Swayam Mallick rushed to the spot and
started an investigation into the incident. Though the energy department
was apprised of the elephant movement in the area, no steps were taken by
it, he added.

Another tusker was found dead after it came in contact with live electric
wires allegedly laid by poachers in a paddy field to catch wild boars at
Hemamura village under Handapa forest range of Athamallik block in Angul
district late Tuesday night.
