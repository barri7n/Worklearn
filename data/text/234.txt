SHILLONG: An elephant that had strayed into Bangladesh from Indian territory in search of food was grievously injured when it was shot at by poachers across the border on the intervening night of Tuesday and Wednesday, officials in the Meghalaya Frontier of the Border Security Force (BSF) said. The wild elephant was reportedly shot by Bangladeshi poachers about 400 yards inside Bangladeshi territory in Mymensingh district after. The hungry elephant had strayed into Jatrakona village in the neighbouring country from the jungles of West Garo Hills.

""The elephant suffered four bullet injuries and was serious as per last reports. It was also learnt that one of the tusks (incisor) of the elephant has been chopped off by the Bangladeshi poachers,"" a BSF spokesperson said. He added that that wild elephants from the jungles of Garo Hills often cross the border in search of food.

Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB) has been apprised of the matter by the BSF, which has requested its counterpart to take action against poachers as protection of wildlife is one of their commitment as per an International convention. Elephants from Garo Hills have been known to ""cross over"" to the neighbouring country not only in search of food but are also lured in by the scent of local brew.
