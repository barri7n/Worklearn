BALASORE, Feb. 26: In a serious allegation against the forest officials, reportedly first of its kind, many villagers around Kuludhia forest range in Nilgiri under Balasore division said that the officials have killed an elephant for its tusks.
They later dumped the body near Sataghati near Chataka hills, the villagers charged while demanding a high-level probe. 
While the DFO could not be contacted despite several attempts, his sub-ordinate officials refuted the allegation and maintained that no such death in recent months have ever been reported. 
The villagers informed that the carcass of tusker has been buried in pieces and foul smell is emanating from the spot. n sns
