Three wild elephants, including one calf, have been injured after they fell
into a pit dug at the construction site of a Herbal and Food Park in
Assam's Sonitpur district today.

A calf came out of a herd and ran towards the construction site with the
mother and another male elephant rushing after it when they fell into the
pit dug for laying the foundation of a building of the Patanjali Mega
Herbal and Food Park at the AIDC Complex at Ghoramari area of the district,
a forest official said.

The male elephant managed to come out while the calf was rescued by forest
employees and translocated to Kaziranga National Park after being provided
treatment, Sonitpur West Divisional Forest Officer Diganta Barooah said.

The mother elephant is still stuck in the pit with veterinarians attending
to it.

"The vets suspect that one of the rear legs of the elephant may be
fractured and her condition is being closely monitored," Barooah said.

The forest department has made adequate arrangement for continuing
treatment during the night by installing flood light and providing other
facilities, he added.

"Our people along with the forest department personnel regularly guard the
site against elephant depredation during the night and the herd was not
there for the last couple of days but suddenly appeared near the site this
morning," Park Coordinator and spokesman Uday Goswami said.

Patanjali was also providing all logistic support as requested by the
forest department to shift the female elephant, Goswami added.
