MYSORE/CHAMARAJANAGAR: In a suspected case of poisoning, a 20-year-old elephant died after eating crops that were sprayed with pesticide in Chamarajanagar district on Tuesday.

The pachyderm was found dead in Basavanna's field in Bettadamadalli in Gundlupet police limits. The incident came to light just after the dawn break on Tuesday, after the villagers noticed the massive animal lying unconscious. The landlord is said to be absconding.

Authorities suspect the elephant died after eating maize and tomato sprayed with pesticides to kill pests. The elephant may have strayed into the field the previous night in search of food. The officers are also investigating if the animal came in contact with a live electric wire nearby.

Meanwhile, forest authorities have filed a case against Basavanna holding him responsible for the death of the wild animal. Police have booked the landlord under the IPC, Indian Electricity Act and Wildlife Protection Act.

Three years ago, around four elephants died after eating crops sprayed with pesticides in Mysore.
