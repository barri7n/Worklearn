Two more wild elephants died today in Assam's Nagaon and Udalguri districts, forest 

department sources said. 



The first case is of a three-year-old male calf whicell into a deep drain in Amsoi Tea Estate 

after getting separated from its herd on the Morigaon-Nagaon district border last night. The 

herd was coming from Amsoi hills in Meghalaya. 



The calf was suffocated to death at around 8 A.M. Today as it got buried under loose earth 

which fell on her while her mother tried to rescue it by digging up the ground with her trunk, 

locals said. 



Meanwhile, in Udalguri district, a male adult jumbo was electrocuted at Nalapara in the 

Borangajuli revenue circle in the Indo-Bhutan area. 



The elephant, which had come out of Bornadi Wildlife Sanctuary on the foothills of Himalayas, 

died after it came in contact with high-tension wires, forest officials said. 



There is an allegation that electric transformers kept exposed and electric poles bent down by 

locals so as to harm rampaging wild elephants when they approach human settlements in search 

of food. 



The elephant calf's death in the Assam-Meghalaya border is the third such case in the last two 

months. 



A male pachyderm had died near Jagiroad in Sonaikuchi Hill Track in May while another was 

killed in the Sitajakhala Hill Track area last month.
