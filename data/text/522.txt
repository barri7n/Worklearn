Reserve and Gudalur Forest Range on Sunday and Monday.

One of the elephants that died on Monday was a 25-year-old female and it
died of an infection in its lower jaw. The animal was administered
antibiotics by the forest department, but it was unable to consume food or
water. It was found in an extremely weak condition at Kannampalli near
Cherambadi in Gudalur on Sunday. Antibiotics, glucose and painkillers were
administered to the elephant. Despite showing signs of improvement, it died
on Monday morning.

A calf elephant was found dead inside the Kargudi forest range in the
Mudumalai Tiger Reserve on Monday. Forest department officials said that it
was hunted down by a tiger. The carcass was set on fire.

On Sunday, a female elephant believed to be around 30 years old was found
dead in the Theppakadu Forest Range.

An autopsy revealed that it had died due to indigestion problem.
