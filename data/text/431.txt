The carcass of a middle-aged tusker was found in Angarapada village located
under Banki forest range of Sundargarh district on Friday. Senior forest
officials, including divisional forest officer (Rourkela) and regional
chief conservator of forests visited the spot and took stock of the
situation. A team of veterinary officials conducted postmortem before
burying the carcass.

Forest officials said a herd of nine elephants entered the Anagarapada
village on Thursday. The elephants, who were reportedly hungry, had barged
into the houses and even damaged one located at the entry of the village.
Besides eating cooked rice, raw rice and five kg of raw dal, the elephants
had gobbled up urea and pesticides kept in the room. But after proceeding
about 100 metres from the house, the tusker fell in a paddy field and died
there.
