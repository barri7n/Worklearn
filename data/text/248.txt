An endangered Sumatran elephant was found dead at a recreation park in the Central Java district of Banjarnegara on Wednesday, with park officials speculating that the pachyderm was electrocuted.

The 14-year-old Dona died after she presumably bit a high-voltage wire in her cage at Serulingmas Wildlife Recreation Park.

â€œWhen found, the elephant lay on the floor with her mouth charred. An electrical wire was in her mouth,â€ the Banjarnegara Culture and Tourism Agency chief, Aziz Ahmad, told antaranews.com on Wednesday.

He added that several of the park's enclosures, including Donaâ€™s, were undergoing repairs, leaving some wires that supplied power to welding equipment dangling in the cages.

Dona is thought to have reached one of those wires before biting it, inducing a fatal electric shock.

Elephant tamer Suroyo, 26, who was the first to come across Donaâ€™s dead body, said he was shocked by the incident, having taken care of Dona for the past four years.

â€œDona was a very obedient, always cheerful elephant. Every time we met, Dona always asked to play. I still canâ€™t believe Donaâ€™s gone now,â€ Suroyo said.

Donaâ€™s remains were buried in the park on Wednesday afternoon following an autopsy by police.

Aziz said that with Donaâ€™s death, there remained just one elephant in the park.

Estimates put the number of Sumatran elephants left in the wild at fewer than 3,000, and the species is considered â€œcritically endangeredâ€ by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Conservationists say the remaining population is severely threatened due to habitat loss from illegal logging and palm oil plantationsâ€™ expansion.
