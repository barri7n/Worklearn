COIMBATORE:A tusker about 25 years old died due to electrocution at the
Shanmuga coffee estate in Valparai forest range in the Anamalai Tiger
Reserve (ATR) on Saturday.

The animal seems to have accidentally touched an electric wire passing
overhead with its trunk. The tusks were removed and the carcass buried at
the same place, officials said.

The Forest Department received the information about the dead elephant at
around 3.30 pm on Saturday. However only on Sunday morning did a department
team, including Valparai forest ranger Krishnasamy and forest veterinarian
N S Manokaran, visit the spot.

The officials said they were unable go there earlier as it was located in
the interior. Besides, by the time they got there, it would not be possible
to carry out the postmortem.

“The tusker, about 25 years old, died after it touched an electric wire
passing through the estate with its trunk. This obviously happened when it
tried to raise the trunk. The lone passes over a low-lying area,” said
Krishnasamy.
Dr Manokaran performed the postmortem and took samples from the elephant’s
body which were sent for further analysis.

The increase in the number of incidents of wild-elephant deaths in the ATR
is worrying wildlife activists. However, this is the first time in recent
years that a wild elephant is dying due to electrocution in Valparai.

Sources said that seven elephants had died due to various reasons in the
Coimbatore region in 2015. In the ATR, this is the fifth such death.
