JORHAT: An adult wild elephant was electrocuted in Karbi Anglong district early on Sunday. The elephant was coming out from a nearby reserve forest. According to forest department sources, an electric post fell on the pachyderm when it was coming out of the forest.

"A wild elephant was electrocuted at Tumpeng area under Hamren forest division in the district at around 3.30 am on Sunday. Although the forest staff rushed to the spot, the elephant died before the officials arrived at the spot. Locals said the elephant came out from a nearby forest and tried to enter a human habitation in search of food. But the jumbo accidentally hit an electric post that broke on the impact and fell on it. As a result, the elephant died at the spot," said forest range officer Pranab Terron.

He added, "The elephant was a full-grown adult male animal and it got separated from its herd a few months ago. The lone elephant was roaming areas under Karbi Anglong West forest division for the last few months in search of food.

Elephants frequently come out of the forest and damage several houses in the areas adjacent to the hills.

Another forest officer in the district said, "A big herd of wild elephants comprising about 30 animals including a few calves have been taking shelter in the forests under Karbi Anglong West forest division for the last few months."

Last month, a tusker was electrocuted near Hatigarh tea garden in Udalguri district.
