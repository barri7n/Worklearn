DIMAKUCHI/TANGLA: An elephant calf was found dead in a village in Udalguri
district, wildlife activist Ranjit Tanti said on Monday.

The calf, aged around 8 years, was found dead in a paddy field in
Jorpukhuri village under Nonai forest range.

A team of forest officials rushed to the spot after some villagers informed
them and postmortem of the carcass was carried out on the spot and buried.

The exact cause of the pachydermâ€™s death is yet to be ascertained. Forest
official Kushal Deka added that no injury mark was found on the carcass
during preliminary examination.

The forest official did not find any electric wires, generally put up by
local farmers around their croplands to prevent wild elephants from
destroying their crops.

This is the third incident of elephant death since October 2017 in Udalguri
district, Ranjit Tanti said. In the past few months, there have been a
number of human-elephant conflicts in the Indo-Bhutan border areas of
Udalguri district comprising Hattigarh, Borengajuli, Budlapara, Majuli, and
Bhooteachang tea estates.
