KAZIRANGA: An elephant calf, which suddenly fell down into a narrow drain
at Mikirjan in a tea garden at Behora near Kaziranga National Park and
rescued by its own mother, is now under the treatment of Centre for
Wildlife Rehabilitation and Conservation (CWRC) under Wildlife Trust of
India at Borjuri here. According to Dr Samsul Haque, attending
veterinarian, even though the elephant calf was initially rescued by the
mother elephant, but later in the evening it again fell down, only to be
rescued by local people.

By that time, the calf visibly became very weak and the CWRC was
accordingly informed about it.

The calf was then immediately brought to the CWRC and put under ICU
treatment, said Dr Haque. But now the calf is showing a sign of slight
improvement although it is not out of danger.

While talking about the problems being faced by elephant calves in tea
gardens because of the existence of drainage system at the very corridors
of wild animals, Dr Navin Pandey from Corbett Foundation felt that there is
a need for meaningful talks between the officials of tea gardens and Forest
Department to find out a solution to minimise the tragedy.

Dr Pandey added that often the calves suffered more in many of the cases
and, in some cases, the nature of the injuries remained fatal. He said that
already the elephant corridors in the nation remained very fragmented,
therefore the Government must initiate steps to keep the existing elephant
corridors intact even if these corridors were inside the tea estates.
