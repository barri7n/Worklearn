MIDNAPORE: A sub-adult elephant, member of a herd that was looking for a
calf separated from the same group, died in West Midnapore's Salboni on
Monday night.

A local source said the herd came to the Baghmari village in Salboni on
Monday evening and a calf got exhausted and separated from the group.
Later, forest department officials reached the spot after being informed by
locals and took the calf to Patharkumkumi beat office in West Midnapore.

"Later at night, the herd came back to the spot looking for the calf and
started trumpeting when they failed to locate it. In the process, a
full-grown elephant hit an electric post that fell on a sub-adult jumbo
from the herd killing it on the spot," said a villager.

Though local divisional forest officer, Arnab Sengupta, said the jumbo that
died was 40 years old, villagers claimed that it was hardly 15-20 years old.
