The Second Army Region’s Suranaree Task Force is to seek help from Laos to
find the killers of an elephant in a national park in the border province
of Ubon Ratchathani.

Deputy national police chief Pol General Srivara Rangsibhramanakul said
yesterday the spent bullet found in the body of a male elephant was from an
AK47 rifle, a weapon not used in Thailand.

He did not mention the name of the country the task force contacted to
help, saying only that it was a neighbouring country. However, Ubon
Ratchathani is close to Laos.

The remains of the elephant were found near Huay Sai Yai waterfall in
BuntarikYod Mon Wildlife Sanctuary on Friday. Officials believe it was shot
in the mouth and the bullet penetrated to the back of the animal's body.

Officials believe the animal did not die at the scene of the shooting.

Basing on photos from camera traps installed in the area, the killers are
believed to be a group of armed men in camouflage clothing. The men, using
GPS tracking devices, were believed to have entered the area for illegal
logging.

Authorities believe the men did not intend to kill the animal as its organs
were still intact.

Srivara said that although the elephant was found in the national park, it
is near a no man’s land where there has been fighting between illegal
loggers.
