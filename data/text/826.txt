RANCHI: An elephant died after being electrocuted in Jharkhand's West
Singhbhum district early on Thursday, officials said.

According to Forest Department officials, an elephant was roaming around
Purchiasai village, trying to eat paddy kept in the field. It came in
contact with an electric wire and died on the spot.

In November, a baby elephant had died, drowning in the pond.

Around 100 elephants are roaming around the district, destroying crops and
at times trampling people.
