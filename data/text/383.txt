ATHAGARH: Barely two days after the carcass of a five-year-old elephant was
found in a jungle in Athagarh five days after its death, another elephant
was found marooned near a water body in Debhuin jungle under Narsinghpur
(east) range.

The tusker has been reportedly moving near the water body for the last
three days, but no efforts were allegedly made by the ranger to move it to
safety.

During his visit to the jungle on Sunday, Principal Chief Conservator of
Forests (wildlife) SS Srivastav directed a veterinary team to attend to the
ailing tusker and has warned the field staff of action if they fail to
protect it from poachers.

 He also assessed the circumstances under which a five-year-old elephant
had died. The carcass was found on Friday, five days after its death.
Elephant watchers said though they had intimated the ranger about the
ailing condition of the elephant at least a fortnight back, no action was
allegedly taken leading to its death.
