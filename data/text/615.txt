The brutal killing pattern of the elephant by the poachers was revealed by
the head of the Nakhon Ratchasima-based Conservation Office 7 Mr Thakorn
Lomstaporn yesterday.

He said he was alerted by a foot patrol team of forestry rangers in Papung
wildlife sanctuary that it found a killed bull elephant while on a foot
patrol from Phukok forest in Nam Nao national park to Chulabhon dam.

The team said as it arrived at Huey Pong forest in Pa Pung wildlife
sanctuary, a dead bull elephant was found lying with its right side on the
ground.

A close examination of the decomposed body showed it was shot by unknown
calibre of gun on the left ear, and another shot 20 centimetres from the
first shot below the left ear.

The poachers chopped off itâ€™s trunk and placed it three metres from the
body.

The front head of the elephant was cut off, indicating that the poachers
gouged out the skull of the elephant in order to remove the tusks which is
a brutal pattern of killing the dying elephant.

The elephant was believed to be killed a week ago and was in bad decomposed
condition, the team told him, he said.

The team also sought permission from local police to burn the carcass as it
was emitting disgusting smell, and it was far away from communities, he
said.

He said forestry rangers are checking closed circuit CCTV footages at the
entrance of the Nam Nao national park looking for clues of suspects during
the past one week and will begin combing the scene and adjacent areas for
other evidence to hunt down this group of poachers for court trial.
