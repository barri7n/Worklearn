A wild elephant named Ronaldo was found dead at the gate of the Elephant Breeding Farm at Khorsor in the Chitwan National Park (CNP) on Monday, Rajendra Panohar of the farm said, adding that the elephant might have died due to shock from an electric wire. Chief conservation officer at the CNP Megh Bahadur Pandey declined to comment on the matter. Locals said the elephant died due to shock from the high-voltage electric wire. Ronaldo had attacked and killed a four-month-old child of Dil Bahadur Tamang, of Bachhauli-1, on Saturday night.
