A Sumatran elephant has been found dead in Indonesia's Aceh province with
its tusks cut off, raising suspicion it was killed by poachers.

Genman Sefti Hasibuan, head of the local Conservation and Natural Resources
Agency said the carcass of the estimated 25-year-old male elephant was
discovered Monday inside a palm oil plantation in Karang Hampa village in
West Aceh District.

It was reported to have been rotten and missing its tusks, Hasibuan said
Tuesday. Villagers estimated it died four to five days earlier from gunshot
wounds.

It was the first elephant death in Aceh this year, Hasibuan said, adding
that a team has been sent to the area for investigation.

The International Union for Conservation of Nature listed the animals as
"critically endangered" after their numbers dropped to between 2,400 and
2,800 from an estimated 5,000 in 1985.

Environmentalists say the elephants could be extinct within three decades
unless they are protected.

Sumatra's elephants sometimes venture into populated areas searching for
food due to destruction of their habitat. Some are shot or poisoned with
cyanide-laced fruit, while others are killed by poachers for their ivory.

In February, police in Riau province arrested eight members of a poaching
syndicate and confiscated tusks worth more than $30,000, following the
arrest of a local tusks buyer. The group admitted to have killed at least
six elephants in Riau and neighboring Jambi provinces.
