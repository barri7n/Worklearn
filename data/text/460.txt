A female elephant died of bullet injuries on the outskirts of Bengaluru on
Wednesday.

The officials suspect that the wounds could have been inflicted by either
poachers or a estate owner.

The animal was found, bleeding severely, near the Kodihalli forest range
near the Bannerghatta National Park on Tuesday, sources at the Forest
Department said.

They suspect that the pachyderm might have been shot near Neralatti Kere
near the Karnataka-Tamil Nadu border. There were bloodstains at different
places between Neralatti Kere and Byalamara, sources added. Following the
incident, the Forest and Police Department officials have initiated a joint
investigation.

The post-mortem was conducted and the carcass was burnt at the spot.

Most waterbodies on the elephant corridor, from Male Mahadeshwara Hills in
Chamarajanagar district to Savandurga Range in Ramanagaram district, have
dried due to drought. The movement of elephants for food and water is
common. The animal could have strayed from its herd, sources added.
