In the raging man-elephant conflict in Goalpara district of Lower Assam a
full grown male elephant got electrocuted at Mariyampur village near

The incident occurred when the pachyderm pressed itself against a pair of
electricity posts.

The electricity posts suddenly got uprooted and the high voltage live wires
killed the animal.

“We could hear the wailing sound of the dying elephant from our home which
is five hundred metres from the scene. Our people are very sad at the death
despite the harassment we face because invading wild elephants”, informed
Bipul Rabha, a local youth.

The forest department buried the animal near the scene with due process.

“We have conducted the postmortem and buried it. However, we have found
that the jumbo had deep injuries in its hind legs. It was a man-inflicted
injury by sharp weapons like spear and the elephant probably tried to get
relief from the injury by rubbing the cut with the electricity posts”, said
Balen Das, ranger of Rongjuli range forest.
