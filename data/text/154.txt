Desperate villagers rig garden fences with live electric wire



The residents of several villagers in the surrounding area of Buddhangala Sanctuary are living in constant fear of wild elephants that roam into populated areas at dusk. Recently, two houses in Tissapura colony were razed to the ground and a large stock of paddy devoured by a herd of elephants that entered the colony in the dead of night. Villagers say that the 40 km long electric fence around the Buddhangala Sanctuary had not been maintained for a long time and that the broken wires were lying on the ground. Meanwhile villagers have placed live electric wires on their garden fences to prevent the elephants from roaming into their gardens. However, this modus operandi has resulted in the death of wild elephants of electric shock. The latest was the death of a jumbo in a home garden of Ruhunugama. In this issue, the Wildlife Conservation Department blame the villagers for not cooperating with the department to maintain the electric fence adding that placing  live electric wires in home gardens to counter wild elephant intrusions was a punishable offence.
