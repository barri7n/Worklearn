A rare Sumatran elephant has been found dead in Indonesia's Aceh province
after apparently eating fertiliser.

The body of the six-year-old male was found in a coffee plantation in Pidie
district on Tuesday, said Genman Hasibuan, the head of the provincial
Nature Conservancy Agency.

"We suspect he died of accidental poisoning because we found splattered
fertiliser urea nearby," left behind by a farmer in his hut, Hasibuan said.

The body had no sign of physical injury and still had his tusks, he said.

Hasibuan said eight Sumatran elephants had been found dead in Aceh this
year, mostly by poisoning by poachers, who removed their tusks.

No one has been arrested, he said.

There are about only 2400-2800 Sumatran elephants in the wild, including
500 in Aceh, according to the WWF conservation group.

The population has dropped an estimated 80 per cent in the last three
generations, or 75 years, according to conservation group IUCN.

Poaching and the destruction of their habitat for plantations and farmland
have been blamed for the dwindling population.
