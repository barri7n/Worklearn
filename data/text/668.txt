A carcass of an elephant was found inside the Kahalla, Pallekale reserve
and officials fear it is the carcass of ‘Galgamuwe Dala Puttuwa’. Officials
began to suspect that the ‘Galgamuwa Tusker’ was killed few days ago
(November 24) after the tusker disappeared for over two months.

Suspicions heightened when two suspects were arrested while in possession
of a pair of elephant tusks and ivory organic gemstones.

What caught the eye of officials were that the tusks, which were in
possession of the arrested suspects, had the identical, unique curvature of
the ones of ‘Galgamuwa Dala Puttuwa’.

It was later confirmed that the gemstones and tusks found in fact did
belong to the ‘Galgamuwa Tusker’.
