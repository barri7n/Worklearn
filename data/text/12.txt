Ranchi, Sep 19 : Two elephants died when they came in contact with a 
high-voltage power line near this Jharkhand capital, following which a herd 
of elephants ran amok and damaged several houses and other properties.

While roaming in the Torpa area, 40 km from Ranchi, an elephant died when 
its trunk touched an 11,000-volt electrical line. Another elephant came to 
its rescue and met the same fate.

A herd of 12 elephants gathered near the dead animals and later attacked 
nearby villages and damaged houses, crops and other properties.

Terrified residents of Torpa performed the last rites of the dead elephants 
and offered prayers to Lord Ganesha to save them from the wrath of the angry 
herd.

In another incident, 10 elephants were electrocuted in Dumka district when 
an electric wire fell on them. Forest department officials blame the power 
department for such deaths.

"We have requested the power department several times to raise the height of 
electric wires carrying high voltage but our requests did not make any 
impact on them," said a forest department official.

Elephants, whose habitat has shrunk due to the rapid growth villages and 
towns, often barge into villages, kill humans and damage houses or standing 
crops.

In the past four years, rampaging elephants have killed over 300 people in 
Jharkhand.
