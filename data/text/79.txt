CHENNAI: Forest officials found the body of a 20-year old tusker with bullet wounds near Kalithimbam forest range on Thursday. The poachers had sawn off the ivory bleeding the elephant to death.

In the past year, at least half a dozen tuskers have been poached in the forest of Sathyamangalam, Chamrajnagar and Kollegal divisions, home to two to three thousand elephants. And if the locals are to be believed, the number could be a dozen or more. TN Forest officials suspect the poachers to be from the Karnataka side. Last September, forest department officials arrested a gang from Kadaganalli across the border for poaching a tusker.

The TN and Karnataka Forest Departments, sensing the danger to wildlife in these three forest divisions — where there was no poaching for a decade after Veerappan turned to kidnapping — conducted joint meetings and camps a few months ago. “ After we started co-ordinating with each other, the forests were quiet for a few months," said a forest officer, expressing concern over the latest incident.

Veerappan, who is estimated to have killed 500 elephants, is dead and the STF, after his elimination two years ago, is content with training. The Erode Conservator of Forests has formed special teams to nab the poachers.

Forest officials say that a kilogram of ivory could fetch Rs 20,000 in domestic market but its value increases manifold in the international market. That two dozen more elephants have died of electrocution in the recent past is another story.
