A one-year-old elephant calf that had strayed from its mother earlier and
was redirected into the forest over the weekend, however, returned to human
habitation outside Ayyur reserve forest here in Denkanikottai.

The calf was sighted in Thadigal village last week with mild injuries and
was put back into the forest after treatment. It, however, came out of the
forest on Monday. According to sources, the calf might have been rejected
by her mother.

The forest department was alerted and the calf was given food and treated
for the injuries on its tail. According to forest ranger of Denkanikottai
Arumugam, attempts will made again to send it into the forest.
