A mission is underway to save a baby elephant in southwest China with what
appears to be a severed leg.

The baby elephant, dubbed Kang-Kang, was spotted by a drone and heat
sensing cameras. It appears to have it left-front leg completely severed.

Rescuers hope to capture it and give it medical attention.

Experts said even with the wound healed, Kang-Kang most likely will remain
in a rescue center to live out its days, as its chances for survival in the
wild are very slim.

The team?s first attempt failed as they were unable to find an opportunity
to isolate Kang-Kang from the herd. The grown elephants were very
protective of their injured youth, surrounding it while marching through
the woods.

The team is now considering alternate plans.
