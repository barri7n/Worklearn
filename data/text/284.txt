A seven-year-old elephant found dead in a forest in Phetchaburi's Kaeng Krachan district on Tuesday died from an infected gunshot wound, authorities say. 



The body of the male elephant was discovered in a forest on the side of the Pa Teng-Hua Sok road in tambon Pa Tang. 



The National Parks, Wildlife and Plant Conservation Department's veterinarian Burachat Tanpradit conducted the elephant autopsy on Wednesday. 



A bullet from an 11mm-handgun was found inside the elephant's stomach. the bullet was believed to have pierced the elephant's spleen and one of its lungs. 



The bullet had been lodged in the jumbo's stomach for a long time and could have caused the animal's death, Mr Burachat said. 



The team also found 16 shotgun pellets embedded in the elephant's skin.



The handgun bullet could have been fired by a tourist to scare the animal away, and the shotgun pellets by villagers to stop the elephant damaging their crops, Kaeng Krachan National Park chief Chaiwat Limlikitaksom said on Wednesday.
