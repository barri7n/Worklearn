CUTTACK: Decomposed carcass of a female elephant was recovered in Badamba
forest range under Athagarh forest division on Friday.

Forest officials said the highly decomposed body hints that the female
elephant had died almost nine to ten days ago. "The elephant has died deep
inside the forest near the Dhenkanal border. Due to remoteness of the spot,
our forest personnel could locate it after so many days," said divisional
forest officer (Athagarh), Arun Swain.

Forest officials suspected that the elephant died of old age ailments.
"Preliminary findings suggest that the elephant was over 50 years old and
old age illness could be a cause of the pachyderm's death," added Swain.

A team of forest officials and veterinary doctors visited the spot and
examined the elephant. As the carcass was highly decomposed situation, the
forest officials buried it without conducting post-mortem. "The decomposed
body can cause spreading infections and pose threat to other wild animals.
Hence we buried it. Our veterinary doctors are trying to ascertain the
exact cause of the death," said forest personnel.

Swain said that forest personnel are conducting thorough patrolling in the
forest near the spot. "Poaching is not the reason behind the death.
Poachers hardly attack female elephants as they don't have tusks," said the
DFO.

Cuttack districtâ€™s Athagarh forest division is home to 115 elephants.
