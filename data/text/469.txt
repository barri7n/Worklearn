A pachyderm which received shock from an electricity line succumbed to the
injuries on Thursday morning. The 10-year-old wild tusker was electrocuted
to death at North Wayanad Division Appappara forest range. The carcass of
the tusker was found today morning inclined towards a teakwood tree. An
electric cable was passing nearby.  The region had suffered a power cut on
Wednesday night about 8:30 and it is assumed the cause of power cut could
have been electrocution of the tusker.
