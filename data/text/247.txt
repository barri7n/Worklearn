A 35-year-old female elephant was electrocuted after coming in contact with high-tension electric wires in Dhenkanal district in the wee hours of Sunday.

According to Divisional Forest Officer PK Maharatha, the elephant died when she was passing through the corridor in the Mahabir Road Forest Range.

The local people spotted its carcass and informed forest officials, Maharatha said, adding that an inquiry has been ordered into the incident.

According to the locals, some people have used the live electric wires to save their crops from elephants.

They have been complaining about it to forest officials, but no one is responding to them, the villagers added.

Following the electrocution of five elephants and a wild boar in Ganjam district last month, the death of the heritage animal in Dhenkanal district due to electrocution has raised many questions about the safety of the jumbos as at least 69 elephants have been killed in the State in last four months.
