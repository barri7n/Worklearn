DHENKANAL: In yet another case of elephant death in the state, a female
elephant was found dead under suspicious circumstances in Similipatna near
Ichhapur village under Sadar Forest Range in Dhenkanal district on Monday.

The pachyderm, aged around 12 years was spotted by some residents of
Ballabh Sahi early in the morning, who informed forest officials
immediately.

A team led by Dhenkanal DFO and comprised of forest officials of Sadar
Range reached the spot and conducted the preliminary investigation later in
the morning. They have suspected that the jumbo could have died due to
electrocution. The animal was also appeared to be pregnant from the
physical structure, they added.

Forest officials have launched a drive to disperse an elephant herd which
was seen at a distance of at least 500 meters from the spot where the dead
