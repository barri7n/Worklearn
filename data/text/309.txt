Foresters went to recover the body on Monday morning after the garden authority informed them. The carcass of the tusker was found lying in the kitchen garden of a house and its owner has been arrested. He had allegedly hooked power from high-tension line and laid the open wire on the ground to resist the jumbos from raiding his garden. The elephant died on coming in contact with the wire. Jalpaiguri wildlife division authorities lodged an FIR against the owner of the house with the Metialli police station. "We have identified the man involved in the tapping of power," said Tapas Das, conservator of forests, wild life, northern circle
