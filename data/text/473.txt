An elephant was shot dead by poachers near Ammatti in Kodagu district in
the early hours of Monday. The 20-year-old animal was shot using a rifle
from close range in a coffee plantation.

An official said the carcass of the animal was found at the plantation in
the evening. It may have died of gunshot wounds.

He said the poachers, looking for a wild boar, may have killed the elephant
instead.

Going by the gunshot wounds, the poachers must have shot the jumbo from
close range. "They aimed at his forehead and killed it. It must have died
within minutes," the official said. The bullet has been recovered from the
animal's brain. The postmortem was conducted late on Monday evening.
