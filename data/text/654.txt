Sivasagar: Two weeks after the discovery of a wild elephant's carcass at
Dolopa village in Sivasagar district, another one was found dead at a
nearby location on Monday morning.

Eyewitnesses said the body of the adult male elephant was found at
Majumelia village near Saragua, 30km from Sivasagar town. "Death must have
occurred from bullet wounds as we witnessed injury marks on the elephant,"
a villager said.

Dolopa and Majumelia villages are situated within Thowra Assembly
constituency and regular incidents of man-elephant conflict have been
reported.

Sources said a team of forest battalion personnel was patrolling the area
on Sunday night to push back elephants from human settlements. "They fired
several rounds at the herd, which had sneaked into the area in search of
food," a source said.

"One elephant had strayed from its herd and died after being hit by the
bullets," he said.

Sivasagar divisional forest officer Bidya Bordoloi, told The Telegraph that
the elephant was buried in the adjoining field after post-mortem.

"The post-mortem report confirmed that the elephant died of bullet
injuries. Some parts of the carcass would be sent to the forensic
laboratory for further investigation," he said.

He did not deny the fact that death occurred from bullets fired by the
forest personnel. "Bullets fired at the elephants to push them back might
have hit the elephant. This will be revealed only after further
investigation," he said.
