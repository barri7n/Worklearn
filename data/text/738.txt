ANGUL/DHENKANAL: A 10-year-old male elephant was electrocuted in Teltaila
village under Mandargiri reserve forest of Angul forest range on Thursday
night while a 40-year-old injured tusker in Dhenkanal has not been
responding to treatment.

At Teltaila, some villagers spotted the carcass of the elephant near the
village and informed forest officials.

DFO V Karthik said the elephant appeared to have died after coming in
contact with a live wire. Investigation is on to find out who laid the live
wire and postmortem report of the animal is awaited, he added.

In Dhenkanal, the tusker that had sustained injuries last month is not
responding to treatment for the last 15 days.

The tusker has sustained deep injury marks on its body and stayed put in
Kankili forest under Parjang block. Forest officials are unable to go near
the animal as it has been turning violent.

Forest officials said the elephant was injured during infighting in its
herd, but locals alleged that it was attacked by poachers. A team of
experts, led by veterinarian Indramani Nath, examined the tusker on July 29
and suggested for continuation of oral medications, but it has not been
responding to the medicines.
