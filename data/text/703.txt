JORHAT: The carcass of two adult male elephants, who have been electrocuted
to death, were found in a tea garden in Karbi Anglong district on Monday
morning.

The incident took place at around 3am on Monday at Dhansiri tea garden,
about 25 km from Bokajan town, under Borpathar police station.

Members of the forest staff said the elephants had visited the tea garden
in search of food and came in contact with a high volt electric wire while
they were returning to the forest.

"Both the elephants were adult males. Preliminary investigations suggest
the trunks of the elephants touched the live wire while passing through the
tea garden. They were killed on the spot," said a forest officer in Karbi
Anglong.
