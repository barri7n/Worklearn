A four-year-old elephant calf died after being run over by a train in Darjeeling district of West Bengal, forest officials said Thursday.

A dead elephant calf was found Wednesday evening near railway tracks in Gulma Forest Range, about 530 km from Kolkata, with injury marks on its body.

An inquiry revealed that the Guwahati-Jhajha Express had passed the spot a little while before the carcass was discovered.

Forest officials said the elephant was a member of a herd that had been attacked by poachers in Nepal a few days ago. This is the third member of the herd to have been killed in the last few days.

On July 22, an elephant's body was found inside the Gulma Forest Range with multiple injury marks caused by poisoned arrows or sharp weapons.

About 11 elephants have been killed in the last two years on the tracks connecting New Alipurduar and New Jalpaiguri. A few days ago, a tiger was run over by a train on the same railway track.

Forest officials have alleged that trains do not abide by the speed restriction while passing through the forest. However, railway officials said speed regulations are imposed and followed by the drivers.
