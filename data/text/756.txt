A baby elephant was electrocuted at Artham village of Komarada mandal on
Sunday morning.

The three-year-old elephant had reportedly tried to damage the transformer,
according to officials of the Forest Department.

The officials asked the villagers of various mandals, including Komarada,
Jiyammavalasa, Garugubilli and others, to be cautious for the next few days
as herd of elephants might vent their ire with the death of baby elephant.

Meanwhile, Minister for Mines and Geology Sujay Krishna Ranga Rao said that
20 trackers were following elephants constantly.

He urged people not to provoke wild animals and inform the nearby revenue
and police officials if they were in the vicinity of their respective
residential areas.
