BARIPADA:  Carcass of yet another female elephant was found in Similipal
biosphere in Mayurbhanj district on Friday. Sources said the carcass was
found by patrolling staff at Haridachua inside Notto reserve forest, about
30 km from Kaptipada range office under Baripada forest division. The
elephant is suspected to have died three days ago.

Assistant Conservator of Forests (ACF) Arun Kumar Patra, accompanied by a
veterinary team from Sarat region, rushed to the spot. The carcass was
buried after an autopsy.

Baripada DFO Sanjay Kumar Swain said, “Its age would be around 50 years.
The elephant might have died due to old age but post-mortem report is
awaited to ascertain the exact cause of death.” While locals claimed that
the elephant was poisoned to death, forest officials denied the allegation.

Deputy Director of Similipal Tiger Reserve (STR) Ajit Kumar Satpathy said,
“It was difficult for the elephant to move around and collect fodder. It
died due to old age and poisoning was not the reason.”

This is the fourth such incident in the last one month. Earlier, three
elephants, including a tusker, were found dead in the district.
