Hassan: They were installed to keep elephants from straying into villages
and destroying crops, but the rail fences seem to be proving dangerous for
the jumbos.

An elephant appears to have injured itself while trying to cross the spiky
fence in the Nagarhole National Park. Farmers near the fringes of the park
noticed bloodstains on the rail fence and informed a wildlife volunteer in
the Ankammanahalla area of the Veeranahoshalli range.

Having checked the spot and spoken to tribals, the volunteer says the
injured elephant has been spotted limping and roaring in pain in the
forests.

"A few tribals tried to venture near it, but it  drove them away," he told
the Deccan Chronicle. On Tuesday the elephant was not able to stand on its
bleeding foot,  according to him.

The volunteer found to his concern that  the iron spikes on the fences were
rusted and what is more claims to have come across found similar iron
spikes on the concrete fence along  the Taraka reservoir on the fringes of
the Nagarhole National Park and along the Hosahalli boundary in the
Antrasante range.

While director of  the Nagarhole National Park, Manikandan says they are
trying to monitor the injured jumbo, a wildlife conservationist insists it
is time to do something about the situation.

"The injury caused to the Nagarhole jumbo should open the eyes of forest
officials to the threat posed by the rail fencing to animals and they
should remove it at least now, " he adds.
