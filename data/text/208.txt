The man-animal conflict has claimed the life of another elephant. A speeding truck on its way from Kerala to Gundlupet in Chamarajnagar ran over a three-month-old calf at Moolehole in the Bandipur Tiger Reserve on Wednesday night.

Even when the matter pertaining to the ban on night traffic on the Bandipur-Mudumalai and Bandipur-Sultan Batheri route is pending before the apex court, and the State Forest Department and its Tamil Nadu counterpart are initiating several measures to prevent animal deaths on the highway, the death of a three-month-old calf has come as a shock to wildlife lovers.

The mishap, which occurred at around 7 pm on Wednesday â€” when the female elephant calf was returning to the forest after slaking its thirst at Moolehole (river) â€”  is one of the worst road kills in the past seven years.

â€œThe mother and calf were crossing the road when the speeding truck heading towards Gundlupet in Karnataka hit the calf. The calf was stuck beneath the vehicle and was dragged for about 50 feet,â€ said a source in the Forest Department.

On a tip-off by a passerby, forest officials stopped all the vehicles at Maddur checkpost and seized the truck. â€œWe checked all the vehicles and identified the truck from the elephant skin and flesh that was stuck on the wheels,â€ he said. Principal Chief Conservator of Forest and Chief Wildlife Warden B K Singh told Deccan Herald that the driver of the truck, Abdul Azeez, a resident of Kozhikode in Kerala, was arrested under the Wildlife Protection Act and produced before the court.
