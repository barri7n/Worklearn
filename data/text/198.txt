The villagers of Attankadawala in Bakamuna have caught a wild elephant wounded from gunshot injuries and are feeding it after informing the wildlife veterinary officers about the wounded elephant.

This village had recently suffered much due to the human-elephant conflict. Seeing the wounded and helpless elephant that was unable to find food and drinking water, the villagers had informed about it to the Angamedilla Wildlife office.

On the request of the villagers, the wildlife officers had caught the wounded elephant and tied it to a tree and handed over the elephant to the villagers to take care of it. Thereafter the villagers have started providing leaves from Jak trees, Kitul and coconut trees as food for the elephant.

The Mahaweli zone veterinary surgeon of the wild life department W.A. Dharmakeerthi is treating the gunshot wounds of the elephant.

The villagers said that they would release the elephant back to the wild once it is healed.
