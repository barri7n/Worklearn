Wile elephants have been entering plantations on the fringe of jungles at 
the foothills of Western Ghats next to Palani. They have been damaging crops 
and posing a danger to human beings.

In order to prevent their entering his plantation, a farmer of Sattaparai 
had erected an electric fence. A female elephant, which came into contact 
with fence, was electrocuted.

Forest Department officials who arrived at the spot had a post-mortem 
conducted by veterinary surgeons. The dead elephant was buried at the same 
spot.

Five elephants, which had accompanied the female animal have refused to 
budge from the place and are standing there mourning the death of their 
female colleague.

In a fit of anger, they are also damaging the nearby plantations. Herds of 
other elephants are also arriving at the spot and shedding tears. People of 
this area are watching these elephants with awe and panic.
