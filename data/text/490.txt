Two elephants were electrocuted to death in Karanji village under
Tangi-Choudwar block within Cuttack Forest Division limits on Sunday night.

The two female elephants aged 15 and 10 years respectively came in contact
with live wire after they strayed into Srikhetra Garden located on the
premises of Sri Maa Aurobindo Ashram under Safa Section of Dalijoda Forest
range, Bairi.

The electric wires were drawn illegally from the house of two persons
staying inside the Ashram, said DFO Sudarsan Patra.

The jumbos succumbed on the spot. The bodies of the pachyderms were found
lying separately at a distance of 100 metre inside the garden.

On being informed, Forest officials rushed to the spot and conducted an
enquiry. The bodies of the elephants were buried after postmortem.

The Forest Department has lodged a complaint against Radhakanta Panda and
Dharani Dhar Pal, the two persons from whose house the electric wires were
drawn illegally, under Wildlife Protection Act.

Officials of CESU have also launched a probe into the illegal extension of
electric wires which led to electrocution of the two jumbos.

On March 20, a mother elephant and her calf were electrocuted at Dihasahi
village near Choudwar within the limits of same Safa Section in Dalijoda
range of Cuttack Forest Division.
