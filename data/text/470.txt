A ten-year-old female elephant was electrocuted in the Megamalai
Wildlife Sanctuary in Tamil Naduafter it came into contact with a low
hanging overhead electric line.

Forest officials found the carcass near Kadarna estate - a cardamom
estate - in Chinnamanur range of Thenpalani division of the sanctuary
on Saturday evening and informed senior officials. The elephant could
have died six days ago, they said.

After coming into contact with the electricity line, the elephant fell
into a ditch covered with thick bushes.

A postmortem was conducted on Sunday, and the carcass was disposed of.

There are several lines inside the forest taking power to private
estates and villages.

Forest officials headed by wildlife warden P Sornappan conducted an
inquiry. Conservator of forest, Madurai circle, Nihar Ranjan ordered
an inquiry with the electricity board.

"We are holding an inquiry to find out the reasons of electrocution.
Based on the outcome, next course of action will be taken," he said.

The department might ask the electricity board to raise the low
hanging lines by increasing the number of poles and to insulate them
wherever it was required, official sources said.
