Second jumbo death in Sambalpur in 4 days, ivory mafia suspected (India) Ajit Nayak, Times of India Jan 25, 2014 SAMBALPUR: Close on the heels of the killing of an elephant in Jamenkira block, another jumbo has been shot dead in Dhama range of the district. This raised a sharp reaction from animal lovers and environmentalists. Just as in Jamenkira, poachers first shot the elephant dead and severed its head with a sharp weapon and left with both tusks, leaving the carcass in the jungle.
Forest official sources disclosed that the carcass of the elephant was recovered from Ludhagura jungle near Larasara in Dhama range, 40 km away from here, on Friday after it was spotted by villagers who informed the forest department. "We cremated the elephant after conducting an autopsy on Friday. It was about 15-years-old and we suspect the involvement of the ivory mafia behind the killing," DFO (Sambalpur) Santosh Joshi said on Friday.
He said the elephant was shot dead three to four days ago and the poachers left the body after chopping off both tusks. "However, we will confirm the exact time of death after receiving the post-mortem report," Joshi added. An elephant was shot dead in Jamenkira range of the district four days ago (January 20) and its tusks were taken away by poachers after dumping the body in Landijharan forest of the range. The killing of two elephants in the district within a span of four days has sparked sharp reaction from environmentalists and animal lovers. They said the forest department had to be more vigilant and check poachers and the ivory mafia.
