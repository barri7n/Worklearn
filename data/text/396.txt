Carcass of a tusker was found by forest officials inside the Similipal
Tiger Reserve (STR) on Saturday. The carcass, with the tusks removed, was
spotted inside Teltangia forest under Baijatala range, 23 km away from
Rairangpur forest division.

The forest officials suspect the animal could have been poisoned and it
could be the handiwork of a well-organised poaching racket.

A herd of 10 elephants has been seen moving around the forest for over a
month now and it had strayed into human habitations nearby and damaged
crops and houses. Locals said the elephant could have been a part of the
herd. Rairangpur DFO AK Swain, forest staff and a veterinary team rushed to
the spot. They buried the carcass after autopsy.

Wildlife activist Akshay Biswal said some unknown persons were seen moving
in the area after the elephant herd strayed into villages.

Deputy Director of STR Ajit Kumar Satpathy said the exact cause of death of
the tusker can be ascertained after the postmortem report is received.
