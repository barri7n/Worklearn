TURA: There seem to be no end in sight to the raging man and animal
conflict with yet another prized elephant losing its life to human
development in the Garo Hills region.

An adult male elephant moving through  Baghmara reserve forest was
electrocuted early Saturday morning after coming in contact with a powerful
11 Kilo Watt transmission line that was passing through the reserve area.

The solitary male pachyderm came in contact with the power line passing
through the forests, at around 3:30 AM, at a place called Bhawanipur, 6 kms
from Baghmara, on the road towards Rongara. The electric power transmission
line passing through the forest region gives electricity to the Rangasora
village area.

Preliminary investigation indicates that the elephant, which reportedly had
cuts and sores in some parts of its body, may have tried to scratch itself
to a fallen tree that had touched the power line.

This is not the first time animals, especially elephants, have died from
human activities along its route. Vast stretches of the reserve forests in
Baghmara and Rongara are home to dozens of herds of pachyderms that
crisscross to and fro Baghmara forests and into the plains of neighbouring
Bangladesh.

Several elephant tragedies have occurred in the recent past, a majority of
deaths occurring from electrocution.
