A critically endangered elephant has been found dead in a palm oil
plantation on Indonesia's Sumatra island in what is suspected to be a
deliberate poisoning, an official said Friday.

The 10-year-old female Sumatran elephant was found in Jambo Reuhat village
in North Aceh on Thursday -- the third of its species to be found dead of
suspected poisoning in the same palm plantation since 2015.

"We found fruits and a pouch with traces of powder inside the animal," Aceh
conservation centre head Sapto Aji Prabowo told AFP.

"We suspect the death was caused by deliberate poisoning because her liver
and spleen turned dark, a classic sign of poison," he added.

A group of veterinarians was deployed to the location after authorities
were tipped off by locals.

Officials estimated the animal had been dead for three days when the
carcass was discovered.

Sumatran elephants are a critically endangered species. Rampant
deforestation to create plantations has reduced their natural habitat and
brought them into conflict with humans.

At least 11 wild elephants died in Aceh last year, most of them killed by
humans.

Earlier in June a tame Sumatran elephant was found dead from apparent
poisoning in East Aceh district with its tusks missing.

Officials found the remains of fruits laced with poison inside the animal
during the autopsy.

The environment ministry estimates only around 500 Sumatran elephant remain
in Aceh.
