CUTTACK: Carcass of a female elephant was found at Paikerapur village under
Khuntuni range in the district on Wednesday.

Some locals found the carcass of the 8-year-old jumbo near the cyclone
shelter of the village and informed the forest officials.

Though the exact cause of the death of the pachyderm is yet to be known,
police and forest personnel suspect that the animal might have died due to
electrocution as a 33 KV electric wire has passed through the area.
However, the exact reason behind the death of the elephant can be known
post the autopsy.

“We got information about the elephant’s death from the locals. We do not
know under what circumstances the animal has died. However, experts from
OUAT (Bhubaneswar) will conduct the postmortem following which we will come
to know the reason of the animal’s death,” said Khuntuni range officer.
