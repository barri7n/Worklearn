An elephant was found dead by locals and regional officials in a forested area near West Bengal's Jalpaiguri district on Sunday.

No signs of any external injury were found in the preliminary examination conducted by experts.

"We have not been able to ascertain the reason behind the death of this elephant. That can only be found after a post mortem," said Subhash Chandra Ghosh, a forest ranger.

Experts have repeatedly opined that massive deforestation, poaching and people encroaching upon forest corridors have forced the elephants to move out of their natural habitats in search of food and water.

India has over 50 per cent of Asiatic elephants, considered to be among the most intelligent animals, but their population has dwindled in recent years.
