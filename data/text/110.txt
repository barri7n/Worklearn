BHUBANESWAR: A seriously injured female elephant fled into the forest after locals shot at her in Kumarbasta village, about 30 km from here, on

Wednesday night. The animal, about 60-years-old, sustained three bullet injuries on her right leg, official sources said. 

The elephant is a member of a seven-member herd that strayed into the villages and paddy fields on the periphery of Chandaka sanctuary, spreading panic among villagers. 

DFO (Chandaka) A K Patnaik said, "We are keeping an eye over the injured elephant. Though it separated from its herd in the morning, by evening it entered the forest and is close to its herd." 

"The bullets fired at her are probably from a country-made gun. We would provide medical aid after the animal stops its movement. Otherwise, it will be difficult to capture it," he said. 

Bansidhar Mahalik, a villager, said, "The herd entered the paddy field near our village on Thursday night. Many were chasing it. Someone might have shot at it. During winter, elephants stray into paddy fields in search of food and they even attack human beings and destroy houses. Every year, five to six persons die due to tusker attack in and around the sanctuary." 

"People are aggrieved over the increasing elephant menace. Some of the angry villagers might have attacked the animal. Last year, an elephant was shot dead by villagers," a forest guard said.
