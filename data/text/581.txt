Close on the heels of six pachyderms losing their lives to electrocution in
Kodagu, one more elephant died due to the same reason, taking the toll of
elephants in July alone to seven.

A 12-year-old female elephant was electrocuted at Abyathamangala.

A dry tree was found fallen on electricity wires, which was supposed to be
the reason of the animal's death.

As the electricity officials alerted the Forest department staff, District
Forest Officer Suryasen visited the spot.

Claiming that coffee planters were not cooperating with the Forest
department, Mr Suryasen said it was the responsibility of the planters to
clear dry and fallen trees from their estates
