Two rare Sumatran elephants have died of suspected electrocution after they
came in contact with an electric fence in Indonesia's Aceh province, local
media are reporting.

The elephants were found dead by locals in the East Aceh district on Sunday
with their tusks still intact, the head of the nature conservancy agency in
Aceh, Sapto Aji Prabowo, told the Antara news agency.

Local residents have installed electric fences around their fields to ward
off invasions by wild animals.

Fewer than 3,000 Sumatran elephants are left in the wild, according to
conservation group the World Wildlife Fund. The group identifies the
animals as "critically endangered."

The loss of their habitat to logging and industrial activities forces them
to raid crops in search of food, leading to conflict with communities, WWF
said.
