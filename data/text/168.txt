Ranchi, Dec 22 (IANS) Two elephants were electrocuted when they came in contact with a high-voltage cable in Jharkhand's Gumla district Wednesday, police said.



According to the police, the elephants were killed in Londra village that comes under Bharno police station of Gumla district, around 140 km from here. The elephants hit an electric pole in a field and a wire carrying around 11,000 volts of power fell on them. Both died on the spot.



Around 30 elephants have been killed due to electrocution in Jharkhand in the last ten years. The forest officials blame the electricity board for such incidents. The height of wires carrying high-voltage is low in many areas, so the elephants are often electrocuted.
