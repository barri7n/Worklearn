COIMBATORE: A large abscess from the left foreleg of a 25-year-old elephant
was removed today by forest department veterinarians at Anaikatti on the
city outskirts.

The pachyderm was found struggling to walk by villagers who then informed
forest department officials on Friday last.

The veterinarians, who rushed to the spot, rejuvenated the pachyderm by
feeding it sugarcane, salt and other fodder, after which they decided to
perform the surgery .

However, it hid in a thick bush, delaying treatment after which two kumkis
(tamed elephants) were brought in to control it during surgery and an earth
mover placed as standby, department sources said.

Officials managed to bring it out of the bush later and tranquilised it.
the surgery was then performed and the abscess removed, they said.

The pachyderm later moved towards a stream, the officials said, adding that
two teams have been formed to monitor its movement and condition.
