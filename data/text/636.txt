Tura (Meghalaya): Two elephants were found dead near Jelajuripara village
in South West Garo Hills district today early morning, police said.

The elephants were reportedly moving towards Bangladesh from India when
they died, the police said.

The animals were found dead near the Indo-Bangla border and the exact cause
of their death could not be ascertained, the police said.

"We received information about the two elephants this morning and went to
investigate. We informed the forest officials and they informed the
wildlife team," SWGH Superintendent of Police Bobby Momin said.

No external injuries were found on the carcasses and the police suspect
that the elephants could have died of food poisoning, the SP said.

A wildlife team later performed an autopsy to determine the cause of death
of the animals.

The tusks were allegedly sawed-off even before the wildlife team reached
the spot.

Later, two of the tusks were recovered from the spot.
