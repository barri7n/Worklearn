With a two-year-old tusker found dead on Saturday, the Mudumalai Tiger
Reserve (MTR) in the Nilgiris has seen seven elephants deaths since January
this year. However, MTR officials say the mortality rate is not alarming as
the reserve has over 700 elephants.

Forest watchers on routine patrolling had found the carcass of the tusker
at Kumbarakolly reserve forest in Theppakadu range on Saturday. According
to MTR field director Srinivas R Reddy, preliminary report of the
post-mortem revealed that there were worms inside the stomach of the
animal. "We could not guess the cause of the death. Samples of the carcass
were collected for lab test. Once the report is received, we would come to
know the exact cause of death," he told TOI.

Asked whether it is not a cause of worry to learn that about seven
elephants had died since January, Reddy said, "It is not an issue at all.
The acceptable mortality rate is around 5-10% of the elephant population.
We hadn't touched even 5% ever. MTR houses around 700 Asian elephants. The
reserve can safely lose 70 elephants a year. But at the same time, we
should also see to it that 70-75 new elephants are added to the population
every year".

According to Reddy, more cases of animals deaths during the summer season
is natural, owing to depleted fodder and water sources.
