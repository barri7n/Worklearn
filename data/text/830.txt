The dessicated carcass of a dead elephant has been found in Kaeng Krachan National Park, in Phetchaburi province, about three kilometres from where another elephant was found dead on March 8. 
 
Chaiwat Limlikhit-aksorn, the park chief, said he was informed of the find by villagers on Tuesday morning and rushed to the scene. 
 
He said the elephant appeared to have been dead for at least three weeks. It was found near a water reservoir. 
 
The animal's skull was found about three metres from the main carcass. The ivory tusks and the skin had been removed. 
 
There appeared to be bullet holes in the skull, but forensic checks would be needed to confirm this. 
 
Mr Chaiwat said he was believed the elephant was killed by poachers for its ivory. Other marketable parts of the elephant, including the tail hair and its trunk, were untouched. 
 
On March 8, a female elephant believed to be between seven and 10 years old was found dead near a creek in the same national park. 
 
The elephant had several wounds, including four bullet holes in its hide. Two men were arrested as suspects in the poaching of the elephant. 
 
Police later seized around 90 firearms from local people to for tests to determine whether they were used to kill the elephant or not.  No results have been announced.
