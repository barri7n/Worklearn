MALAPPURAM: Forest officials on Wednesday morning conducted a detailed autopsy of the tusker found dead inside the  Karulai forest range near Nilambur on Monday but failed to establish the cause of death. The post-mortem examination of the elephant, aged around 45 years, was conducted by forest veterinary surgeon Arun Sakkaria.



The elephant was found dead about three km from Mundakkadavu. Its throat was cut open while there was a deep wound near its left eye.



"The samples of its blood and internal organs have been collected for a detailed chemical examination. They will be sent to the wildlife disease diagnosing laboratory at Wayanad and the results will be available in a week," range officer B Harishchandran said. "The preliminary examination could not confirm the role of poachers. A detailed examination with metal detectors was conducted today but we could not find any bullet in the body."



He ruled out the possibility of attack by other elephants. "We believe that the tusker was a loner. The same animal was spotted alone several times in human inhabited areas of Thanippoti, Palankulam and Changaramkode regions. It was a threat to farmers in the region."



Divisional forest officer, Nilambur (south), C V Rajan was also present during the one-hour postmortem examination.
