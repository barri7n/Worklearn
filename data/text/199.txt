LAKHIMPUR (UP): Three wild elephants, including a calf, were electrocuted when they pulled down an electric pole near Suheli in north Kheri forest division, official sources said today.

The incident occurred last night when a herd of elephants was crossing the area, which is close to Dudhwa Tiger Reserve (DTR), they said.

Apart from the calf, the dead pachyderms include one fully grown male and a female elephant both aged around 30 years.

Local residents informed DTR, north Kheri and power department authorities about the incident.

Range officer (Nighasan) A K Singh told PTI that the elephants came in contact with live cables after they pulled down the electric pole, which led to the electrocution of the three pachyderms.

Herds of wild elephants regularly migrate into Dudhwa Tiger Reserve from adjoining forests in Nepal in search of food and shelter in the park.

These tuskers often sneak into populated areas of Nighasan, Majhgain, Belrayan and Tikonia and destroy crops and human habitations.
