Four wild Asian elephants that got drunk on rice beer have been electrocuted 
in the northern Indian state of Meghalaya.

A forest official said a herd of about 24 elephants went on the rampage in a 
remote area in the West Garo Hills district.

"The elephants, after getting high on rice beer, started dashing against an 
electric pole. A live wire fell, killing four elephants instantly," said the 
official.

Wild elephants have been targeting areas in Meghalaya and the adjoining 
state of Assam where people brew large volumes of rice beer, reports the 
Kerala Nextwebsite.

"We have come across devastating drunken bouts by herds that have developed 
a liking for country liquor," said Kushal Konwar Sharma, a noted elephant 
expert.

In the last two years, elephants have killed at least 180 people in Assam 
and Meghalaya. Angry villagers, in turn, have killed up to 200 of the 
animals.

The last elephant census in 1999 recorded 7,200 wild elephants in Assam and 
Meghalaya, more than half of India's count of 10,000.
