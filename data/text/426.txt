A three-year-old male elephant was found dead near Andhiyur in Erode
district on Wednesday.

According to forest officials, they were alerted by the local villagers on
Wednesday morning about the elephant's death. "The elephant carcass was
found at Palaru Beat in Sennampatty forest division at Andhiyur," said M
Nagarajan, Erode district forest officer.

Forest officials rushed to the spot with veterinarians and performed an
autopsy on the spot. During the autopsy, veterinarians found it had
suffered a serious head injury. "It is possible that the elephant fell into
