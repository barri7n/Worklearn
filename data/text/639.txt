Dibrugarh: The death of two elephants in a row at Lorua Mouza here under
Barbaruah PS has created considerable sensation in the district.

Local residents have said that elephants at Sesa Nagaon and at Kolakhowa
died due to their contact with electric fences.  For the past five years,
residents of the area had been constructing electric fences for protection
of their land and houses from elephants.

The local people have blamed the forest department, including the Regional
Forest Officer and Block Development Officer, for failing to take any
concrete steps to check deaths of elephants in the said areas.
