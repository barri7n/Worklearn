Two forest officials were suspended for laxness in their duties, while a
ranger has been issued a show cause notice by the Divisional Forest Officer
(DFO) in Dhenkanal on Wednesday.

A Forester identified as Ajit Dalei and another a Forest Guard identified
as Divya Singh have been suspended by the Dhenkanal DFO as part of
departmental action for negligence in their duties pertaining to the case
of a tusker death at Kandara Reserve Forest in Bimbhori.

Notably, the elephant carcass was found nearly three to four days back,
which was supposed to have been fired at by poachers. The tusker did not
have his teeth while it was recovered fuelling suspicions that it could
have been taken away by the hunters, sources said.
