‘Illegally drawn power lines for private purposes is causing death of wild
animals,’ says wildlife activist

A tusker was found dead reportedly after coming into contact with a live
electricity wire at Guddadabeeranahalli in Tarikere taluk on Sunday.

The elephant, aged about 25, is reported to have come in contact with the
wire as it tried to enter the cotton field of Sridhar.

D. Manjunath, Deputy Conservator of Forests, Bhadravati division, told The
Hindu that the incident occurred at the Lakkavalli range of Bhadravati
division.

“The elephant was found dead close to the Bhadra Tiger Reserve area. We
have booked a case with the police against Sridhar, owner of the land,
besides the Mangalore Electricity Supply Company (MESCOM). Sridhar and his
family members are absconding,” the officer said.

G. Veeresh, a wildlife activist who visited the spot, said that this was
the second such incident in two months. Another elephant had died in
September. “Illegally drawn power lines for private purposes had been
causing death of wild animals. The Forest Department should take stern
action against those responsible for such incidents,” he pointed out.
