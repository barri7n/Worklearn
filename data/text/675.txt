JALUKBARI: A female elephant was found dead with its trunk missing near
Mikirpara, one kilometre away from the Rani Reserve Forest, today.

Sources said an elephant calf was also found a few days ago a few
kilometres away from the place where the female elephant was found dead
yesterday.

The elephant had probably come down from the forest in search of her lost
calf, but later she fell into Deepor Beel, and, for a few days, could not
get out of it. Later, she returned to the reserve forest, but was found
dead today.

It may be mentioned that a few days ago, locals near Deepor Beel rescued an
elephant calf and it was handed over the Forest department.
