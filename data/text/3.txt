Pekanbaru, Jan 29 (ANTARA) - Two male elephants were found dead after being 
poisoned by unidentified persons at spot near the elephant training center 
(PTL) in Duri area, Bengkalis district, Riau, recently.

Chairman of a local non-governmental organization on wildlife, Gamatra, said 
here on Thursday the two giant animals were found with their tusks gone. "I 
think the killers were professionals working for a syndicate," he said.

It was assumed the killers were members of an elephant-killing syndicate as 
the tusks had been cut without hurting the elephants, he said.

In addition, female elephants wandering in the location were left untouched. 
"This is an indication that the killers only wanted to get the tusks because 
female elephants don't have tusks," he said.

Their modus operandi in killing elephants was by putting poison inside 
pineapples. The sample of poison had been taken to a laboratory in Bukit 
Tinggi for further examination.

Named 'Kola' and 'Amid', the two dead elephants were aged between 15 and 20 
years.
