A female elephant aged about 60 years, which had come in search of food and
water, died after being electrocuted at Chikkabaragi village coming under
Hediyala Forest Range in Bandipur Tiger Reserve on June 20.

The elephant tried to enter the farm of one Shivallamma in search of
fodder. Shivallamma had erected a fence around the farm and had connected
power to it illegally. The elephant, which tried to enter the farm, came in
contact with the powered fence and died, according to sources in the Forest
Department.

buried. A case has been registered in this regard.
