VietNamNet Bridge – While local police hadn’t finished investigating the deaths of two wild elephants in the Vinh Cuu Nature Reserve in the southern province of Dong Nai, three more elephants were found dead in the reserve on July 8.
The body of a male elephant which was shot to death in Dak Lak province. 
The three elephant bodies were discovered in a forest in Dinh Quan district. The two smaller elephants were huddled against the stomach of the big elephant.
 
The elephants are said to have died by poisoning. Their position is around 6 km from the site where the two elephant bodies were detected previously, or the border area between Nam Cat Tien National Park and Vinh Cuu Nature Reserve.
 
According to forest rangers from the Nam Cat Tien National Park, the dead elephants are members of a herd of elephants that reportedly disturbed local people early this year.
 
Experts collected samples from the dead elephants for testing.
