An adult tusker was electrocuted at Duramari in Dhupguri block's Moraghat
range. The incident took place on Monday.

The elephant had raided a potato field near the village near Khuttimari
forest. The field located at Kerani Para in Duramari belongs to one Dhwajen
Adhikary, who had allegedly hooked power from high tension line and laid
the open wire on the ground to prevent the jumbos from raiding , said a
forest official.

The elephant died on the spot on coming in contact with the wire.

On Monday morning, villagers of Duramari saw the carcass of the elephant
lying on the field electricutedwith electric wires on its trunk. Primarily
Foresters are certain of electrocution. It was the villagers who informed
the forest department about the incident. "The signs on the body indicated
that the elephant died of electrocution. The department has lodged an FIR
against the land owner," honorary wildlife warden Seema Chowdhury said.
Dhwajen is on the run from police.

Tapping of power from high tension wires and laying of electric traps for
jumbos is a common practice in this part of the state, especially in Dooars
and Terai. People living in the forest villages and on the fringe areas do
this to stop elephants from sneaking into their habitat and paddy fields,
especially during the time of harvesting.
