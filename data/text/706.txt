A tusker, which had entered a private plantation in Palangaala village in
Virajpet taluk of Kodagu district, was found shot dead on Thursday.

The tusker was around 25 to 30 years old. Deputy Conservator of Forests of
Virajpet D. Maria Christu Raja confirmed that it was shot dead but they
were yet to recover the bullet from the scene of crime. The elephant had
died in a kneeling position, lending credence to the suspicion that the
bullet had killed it instantly.

Post-mortem was under way late on Thursday and a complaint has been
registered with the Judicial Magistrate First Class at Virajpet. The
authorities said no arrests had been made yet.

Incidents of human-elephant conflict are high in Kodagu and the presence of
elephant herds in coffee plantations has also caused concern among the
local community. Incidentally, the Synchronized Asian Elephant Census
conducted last year included, for the first time, elephant count exercise
in coffee plantations.
