A 25-year old tusker was found electrocuted in a mango orchad in Hindol
range in Dhenkanal forest division on Monday. The pachyderm broke a branch
of the mango tree, which fell on the electric wire. The elephant was caught
unawares and died instantly, sources in wildlife wing said. "The electric
line was not sagging and it was 15 feet above the ground. The load of the
branch brought it down and the elephant came in contact with it," said
principal chief conservator of forests (wildlife) Siddhant Das.
