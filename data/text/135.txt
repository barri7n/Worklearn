Three wild elephants were electrocuted in a forest area of Orissa's Keonjhar district, an official Sunday said.



The two male and a female elephant died near Durlabhapur village under Telkoi forest division, some 210 km from Bhubaneswar after coming in contact with a high-tension overhead wire, a district forest official told IANS.



Wildlife and forest officials rushed to the spot and began investigation after local residents spotted the dead elephants early Sunday.



Although power lines in forest areas are supposed to be at a specific height above the ground, the rules were not being followed strictly, a wildlife expert said.
