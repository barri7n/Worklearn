KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) â€” The WWF conservation group has called for all forest areas in Malaysia's Sabah state to be protected after the remains of another endangered Borneo pygmy elephant suspected to have been poisoned were found. Authorities found the carcass of the elephant late Wednesday, marking the 14th such death this month. The elephants were feared to have been poisoned because they encroached on Malaysian plantations, giving fresh urgency to activists' warnings of rising conflict between man and wildlife as development accelerates. The WWF says the dead elephants were found in areas where forests were being converted for plantations within permanent forest reserves. It called Thursday for full protection of forest land to preserve the pygmy elephants and other endangered wildlife. Some 60 percent of Sabah is under forest cover
