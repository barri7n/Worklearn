ATHAGARH: A female elephant, aged about eight years old, was found dead at
Rajanagar under Athagarh forest range here on Wednesday morning.

Locals first spotted the pachyderm lying in a pool of blood in a brinjal
field near their village. On being informed, forest officials led by
Assistant Conservator of Forest (ACF) Rajendra Kumar Das and Range Officer
Rabindra Nayak rushed to the spot.

A team of veterinary surgeons from OUAT led by Prof Dr Niranjan Sahoo also
reached the spot and conducted postmortem on the dead jumbo. Block
Veterinary Officer Susant Kumar Behera also assisted the team.

During autopsy, the doctors found that the elephant’s tongue was chafed and
lower jaws broken. It is suspected that something exploded in the mouth of
the jumbo, leading to severe bleeding and subsequently, its death.

Since fresh blood was oozing out of its mouth, it is believed that the
elephant died early in the morning.

Sources said due to lack of proper patrolling, poachers have become active
in the forest.

Since Sukasan reserve forest has a huge population of wild boars, poachers
use bombs to hunt the animals. As per reports, five elephants have died in
the forest in as many months.

It is alleged that some forest officials are hand in glove with the
poachers and have turned a blind eye to the menace.Expressing concern over
the rising deaths of elephants, environmentalists and wildlife lovers
demanded strict action against poachers and the unscrupulous forest
officials involved in the illegal practice.
