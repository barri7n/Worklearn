COIMBATORE: A male elephant was today found dead in a farm near here amid
suspicion that it could have been electrocuted after coming into contact
with an electrified fence, police said.

Forest Department officials from Madukarai went to the farm and noticed it
had an electrified fence.

They suspected that the elephant, about 25 years old, could have died of
electrocution or due to any disease.

The animal may have strayed into the private pumpkin farm in Mathipalayam
village, owned by one Chandran, to consume the vegetable, police said.

There have been incidents in the recent past of elephants and other animals
being electrocuted after coming into contact with such fences.
