Two female elephants were electrocuted when they came in contact with a
high tension cable hanging low at an agricultural farm in Chamarajanagar on
Friday night.

The incident came to light on Saturday. The elephants, who were found dead
in the field of Mohan in Suvarnagar of Chamarajanagar taluk, are suspected
to have come from Yarganahalli in search of fodder.

Both the elephants died on the spot.

Senior officials, including Conservator of Forests Lingaraju, reached the
spot and filed a complaint of criminal negligence against the
Chamundeshwari Electricity Supply Corporation (CESC).
