A 30-year-old elephant was electrocuted after it apparently came in contact
with an illegal electric fence erected around a maize farm near Thalwadi.

Forest Department officials said Michal, the owner of the two-acre farm,
had illegally electrified the fencing around it. It is suspected the
elephant died after coming in contact with it.

Locals on Monday found the elephant dead and informed police and forest
department officials. After removing the tusks, the elephant was buried in
the forest area.

A case was registered against Michal, who is at large, they said.
