Erode: A five-year-old male elephant was found dead of multiple injuries it sustained while it tried to go down a slope in Kombuthookiamman temple area near Anthiyur, officials said.

Forest officials said the villagers noticed the dead tusker yesterday afternoon and informed the forest personnel.
A veterinary doctor who went to the spot with forest personnel, said the calf had tried to descend a slope and got injured. It might have become weak due to the injuries and died, he said.
After a post-mortem, the elephant was buried in the same area, officials said.
They said this is the sixth recorded death of elephants in the area, the others being due to illness, diseases and accidents and one which was shot dead recently by poachers.
