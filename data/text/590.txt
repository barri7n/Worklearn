MUNNAR: An elephant was found dead in the estate owned by ADGP Tomin
Thachankary’s brother in Chinnakanal in Idukki district. The dead elephant
was identified as an 11-year old cow.

Officials from the forest department arrived and examined the premises.
This is the third elephant to die in the forests of Munnar within the past
one month.

The elephant was found dead near the gates of the estate, which has
solar-electric fence going around it. The preliminary report says that the
elephant got electrocuted by this fence. The forest department has ordered
a thorough investigation of the incident.

The electric fence will carry current between stipulated intervals of time
to prevent electrocution. Nevertheless, direct current is passed through
the fence when the solar current is not available, which is against the law.
