Although the years of military conflicts have ended, wild animals are not still free from its consequences.



The latest victim of a landmine laid by the LTTE was a wild elephant that came to drink from the Periyamadu Tank in Omantha.



The explosion had blown off a hind leg of the elephant below the knee. The wildlife officers including the Range Wildlife Conservation Officer W J K Herath, the veterinary surgeon (North-Western Range) Dr. Chandana Jayasinghe and the Sri Lanka Army took prompt steps to treat the seriously injured elephant. Their action saved the animal from certain death.
