Itanagar: The forest department of Pasighat in East Siang district has
caught eight persons in connection with wildlife hunting cases till date
after conducting an inquiry into the crime.

Unabated hunting of wild elephants was reported from the forests in the
Mebo area. Unidentified poachers killed a couple of wild elephants near
Siluk village under Mebo sub-division and captured an elephant calf. They
took it to Dambuk in Lower Dibang Valley, a source said here on Friday.

The forest officials subsequently picked up four persons from Siluk (East
Siang) and Dambuk (Lower Dibang Valley) villages and booked them under
Wildlife Protection (WLP) Acts. Later, they were handed over to police for
further action. The accused, however, managed to get bail.

Later, a joint team of forest department and police nabbed four others,
including two elephant trainers, from Kerem area of Namsai district early
in February. The investigating team also recovered two elephant calves from
their possession.

According to report, the four accused (arrested under WLP Act) have
admitted their offence before the investigating officers.
