Coimbatore: A 55-year-old female elephant, which was sick and fell in a
farmland near Perur, was treated by the Coimbatore forest department on
Saturday and sent back into the forest.

Forest officer M Senthil Kumar said he got information from local farmers
of Karadimadai beat located near Perur in Madhukkarai range that elephants
were spotted on patta land there.

"Since it was a private farmland, farmers were worried. An elephant about
55 years old was extremely weak and was lying down on the land. One calf
and another female elephant were standing over it," Senthil Kumar said.

Meanwhile, the forest officials informed the local veterinarians,
anti-poaching watchers and anti-depradation teams who went to the spot
immediately.

"We wanted to isolate the sick elephant to treat it. So we used crackers to
drive the other two elephants back to the forest. Then we treated the
elephant and injected intravenous fluids into its body. It responded well.
After it became better in the evening, we used 'Kumki' Pari and two earth
movers to lift it," Senthil Kumar said.

In the first attempt, the elephant lay down again. After sometime, the
elephant got up and walked into the forest.

"It was successful operation and we are very happy. Local veterinarians
supported us and we are glad that we have saved the elephant. The elephant
did not have any major disease and it was not pregnant too. It was just
weak due to old age," he added.
