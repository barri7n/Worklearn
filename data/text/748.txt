A 35-year-old tusker was found dead in Amangarh Tiger Reserve (ATR) area on
Wednesday morning.

The body of the tusker was found near Meerapur Maloni village located on
UP-Uttrakhand border in Amangarh Tiger Reserve. It was around 100 meters
inside UP.

According to officials, the dead tusker had few injury marks on its body.
Hence, it is being considered that the elephant might have been hunted by
poachers.

However, the forest officials said that the cause of the death will be
determined only after the post-mortem report is out. A team of Indian
Veterinary Research Institute from Bareilly will come here to carry out
autopsy of the dead elephant on Thursday. The incident came to the fore
when the villagers spotted the body lying on the ground in the forest area.

They then informed the forest officials and rushed to the spot. There are
some injuries on the neck and stomach of the tusker. Divisional forest
officer M Semmaran, however, confirmed that the dead elephant was injured
on its neck.

“The reason of the death is not clear so far. The IVRI team will conduct
post-mortem of the body, and we will be able to say something only after
the autopsy. The post-morterm will be carried out on Thursday,” he said.
