KEONJHAR: A 45-year-old tuskar was electrocuted in the Champua forest range area. The carcass was seized on Wednesday and buried after postmortem. The tusker died after it came in contact with an 11 KV power line that was hanging at a low-level. 

Assistant conservator of forest (Keonjhar) Trilochan Mohanty said, "The full-grown tusker was killed when it came in contact with 11 KV line. It was supposed to be at 13 feet but was hanging at 10 ft." There were burns on the trunk, left leg and near the left tusk. 

The lone tusker was moving in those area since the past few days in search of food. The local villagers gathered near the dead tusker and worshipped it. The electricity cables drawn in these areas are very old. 

Hence, most of the lines hang at lower levels. There had been several instances of elephants dying of electrocution. Two were killed in Lahanda-Mutuda village in the said forest range.
