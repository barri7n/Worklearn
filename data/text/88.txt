Jakarta - Suspected poachers killed two endangered elephants on 
Indonesia's Sumatra island, the state-run Antara news agency reported 
Friday.

The Sumatran elephants were found dead without their tusks Thursday 
in Riau province, Antara said.

Police were looking for the poachers who are believed to have used 
cyanide-laced pineapple to kill the animals, said Sahimin, an official 
at the local nature conservation agency.

'The killers of the elephants will be brought to justice,' he was 
quoted as saying by Antara.

In March, another two Sumatran elephants were killed in Sumatra's 
Bengkulu province.

Conservationists said widespread destruction of elephant habitat 
through illegal logging and uncontrolled conversion of forests into oil 
palm and pulp plantations has created conflict between humans and 
elephants, which are forced to feed on the crops that replaced their 
natural food resources.

Poaching has also been blamed for the dwindling Sumatran elephant 
population, the smallest among the Asian elephants.

The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), a global conservation group, 
estimates there are only about 3,000 Sumatran elephants left on Sumatra, 
the only island in Indonesia where they can still be found.

They are listed as an endangered species and protected by law.
