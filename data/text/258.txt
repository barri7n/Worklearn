An autopsy examination on a dead elephant cow found in Phetchaburi's Kaeng Krachan National Park revealed a rifle bullet in her skull and that she had recently given birth, leading authorities to believe she was killed by poachers who wanted her calf. 
 
National Parks, Wildlife and Plant Conservation department chief Manopat Huamuangkaew visited the park Monday and he was briefed by park chief Chaiwat Limlikhitaksorn. Manopat also visited the scene where the elephant was found. 
 
The autopsy found one rifle bullet and that the elephant had given birth in the past six months. An examination of her teeth determined she was 13 to 15 years old. 
 
Wildlife authorities were collecting additional evidence and the elephant's remains would be burned and sifted in a bid to find more bullet fragments.
