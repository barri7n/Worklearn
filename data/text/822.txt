BARIPADA: The carcass of an elephant calf was found on Odisha-West Bengal
border on Friday.

The carcass was spotted at Dhumsahi village under Kesharekha range of
Kharagpur forest division of West Bengal. The calf is around five years
old.

The calf was part of a herd which had strayed from Dalma forest in
neighbouring Jharkhand to Dhumsahi village. In the village it consumed
excess mahua poch and paddy.

After some time, it started trumpeting and moved around the village leading
to panic among the residents.

The villagers and forest personnel did not approach the calf as it was
surrounded by the herd on Thursday night.

Villagers returned to the spot after the herd left for Dalma forest and
found the carcass, said sources.

Baripada Divisional Forest Officer Swayam Mallik said the carcass was found
in Dhumsahi village bordering West Bengal.

“A herd of 100 jumbos, including 20 calves, had entered  into Mayurbhanj.
The calf was part of the herd and died after consuming excess amount of
‘mahua poch’ and paddy. The herd returned to Dalma forest through
Odisha-West Bengal corridor. As the spot where the carcass was found falls
under West Bengal forest department’s jurisdiction, forest personnel of
Kharagpur range have been informed of the calf’s death,” he added.
