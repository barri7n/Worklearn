Sonepur: Two female elephants died at the Tithipali Reserve Forest in
Subarnapur district on Sunday morning. Though the exact reason behind the
deaths was yet to be ascertained, Sonepur DFO said the pachyderms might
have died after coming in contact with solar fencing wire.

The solar fencing wire was found connected to a live extra-high tension
wire, resulting in the instant death of the jumbos.

It may be noted that three elephants had been electrocuted in the State
last month. While one pachyderm aged between six to seven years died at
Seramunda in the Nuagada Reserve Forest on October 30, two female elephants
were electrocuted at Unani village under Ambabhana block in Bargarh
district on October 23.
