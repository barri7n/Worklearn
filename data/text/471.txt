In yet another incident of wild elephants getting electrocuted in the
forest fringes of Wayanad, a 25-year-old male elephant was killed after it
came into contact with a electric line at Karaputhadi under Muthanga forest
range of Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary (WWS) on Wednesday.

The tusker got electrocuted when it pushed down a coconut tree over the
three-phase power line of the KSEB. The incident took place at a private
land located 200 metres away from the forest boundary.

The carcass of the elephant was found by local residents at 6.30am. The
forest officials headed by WWS warden P Dhanesh Kumar along with KSEB
officials reached the spot. It was confirmed in the autopsy conducted by
assistant professor at the Kerala Veterinary and Animal Sciences
University, Dr Arun Zachariah that the death was due to electrocution.

This is the second case of elephants getting electrocuted in forest fringes
in Wayanad during the last one week. A 20-year-old elephant had died after
it came into contact with an electric line at Appappara near Thirunelli in
North Wayanad Forest division on August 18.
