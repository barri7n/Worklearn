A female elephant was electrocuted in forests of Dharamjaigarh in Raigarh
district after coming in contact with 11 KV high voltage live wire due to
its low height on Monday evening. While forest department officials claim
that they had alerted electricity department to makeshift the low-lying
wire, there was no action taken which later became the reason of elephant's
death.

The incident took place at Chuhkimar forest at Kharsia in Chaal forest
range where a body of female elephant was found. According to information,
the elephant came in contact with high voltage wire leading to its death on
the spot due to electrocution.

The wire was hardly three metres above the ground which anyway posed danger
for both animals and human but officials said that despite informing the
electrical department, no attempts were made to shift the wire.

Villagers could inform forest department about death of elephant only after
a day when the body started staling. It was buried after autopsy. In the
past, such incidents have taken place when locals have purposely laid such
live wires to bother elephants and many tusker have died due to
electrocution.
