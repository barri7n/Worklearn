Local villagers today spotted bodies of two elephants, including a calf,
lying a few meters away from Gunadei canal road near Sadar range along the
National Highway in the district.

The elephant, aged around 15 years, and its calf, around six-month-old, are
suspected to have died after coming in contact with a 33-KV high-tension
electric wire.

The bodies were found lying near the canal, around 100 metre away from
NH-55, this morning.

The pachyderms would have died sometime during last night after coming in
contact with the live wires while crossing the canal, the DFO said. The
carcasses have been seized, he added.

As per reports, the jumbos have changed their path following the ongoing
construction work of Rengali canal. There are low-lying electric wires at
various places through which pachyderms are passing through.

Though the Forest officials have brought this to the notice of the
Electricity department, the latter is yet to initiate steps to avoid
accidents, sources said.

Amid much hue and cry over the twin jumbo deaths, the state government
today filed an FIR against three officials of the local electricity
department and placed two forest officials under suspension.

“FIR has been filed against three staff of electricity department. Case has
been registered against the executive engineer, assistant engineer and a
linesman of the department. Besides, two forest officials—a forester and a
forest guard– were also suspended for dereliction of their duty,” Dhenkanal
DFO informed.
