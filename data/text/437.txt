Two wild bull elephants, each about 10 years old, were found dead near a
well in a rubber plantation in Kaeng Hang Maew district on Monday night, an
official said.

Pitak Yingyong, chief of a forest protection unit in the Khao Ang Rue Nai
game reserve, said he and district police went to the rubber plantation of
Supatra Kangwan, 31, on Monday night.

They had been informed about the dead elephants by the chief of Moo 10
village in tambon Phawa.

They found the two male elephants lying dead near a well.  They were
believed to have died about seven days previously.

Mr Pitak said the two animals might have been electrocuted as there was a
line to the well to power a light and a water pump.
